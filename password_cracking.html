<h2>Dictionary Attack</h2>
<p>A dictionary file is loaded into a cracking application that runs against user accounts. Example: <a target=_blank href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a3vilc0de/PentesterSpecialDict/main/password-attacks/all-pass.txt>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a3vilc0de/PentesterSpecialDict/main/password-attacks/all-pass.txt</a>. 
  The text file contains words commonly used as passwords. The program uses every word present in the dictionary to find the password. Dictionary attacks are more useful than brute-force attacks but can't be used in systems using passphrases.</p>
  <h2>Brute-Force Attacks</h2>
  <p>Every combination of characters until the password is broken. Exhaustive key-search or brute-force search is the basic technique for trying every possible key in turn until the correct key is identified. If the user chooses keys randomly or searches randomly, the plaintext will 
  become available on average after the system has tried half of all the possible keys. It's very time consuming but all passwords will eventually be found.</p>
  <h2>Rule-based Attack</h2>
  <p>Attackers use this type of attack when they obtain some information about the password. This is more powerful than dictionary and brute-force because the attacker knows the password type. By obtaining useful information, such as the method in which numbers and/or special characters have been used, password length etc. 
  attackers can minimize the time required to crack the password and enhance the cracking tool. This technique involves brute force, dictionary and syllable attacks. A combination of both brute force and a dictionary falls into the
  categories of hybrid and syllable password-cracking attacks.</p>
  <h2>Hybrid Attack</h2>
  <p>Depends on the Dictionary attack. Often, people change their passwords merely by adding some numbers to their old passwords. In this case, the program would add some numbers and symbols to the words from the dictionary to try to crack the password. 
  For example, if the old password is "System" then there is a chance that the person will change it to "System1" or "System2".</p>
  <h2>Syllable Attack</h2>
  <p>When passwords are not known words. Attackers use dictionary and other methods to crack them. </p>
  <h2>Password Spraying Attack</h2>
  <p>Password spraying -> targetting user accounts simultaneously using one or a small set of commonly used passwords. Targetting every user in a specific workgroup. Attackers focus on the lockout policy and avoid to get the accounts of the users locked. Password spraying can be performed 
  at different stages through common ports like MSSQL, SSH, FTP, SMB, Kerberos etc.</p>
  <p>Password spraying is performed with <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec>CrackMapExec</a>: crackmapexec smb <IP> -u users.txt -p passwords.txt</p>
<p>The following <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/Greenwolf/Spray/blob/master/spray.sh>Spray.sh</a> command is used to cross-check whether lockout occurred during the spraying process: spray.sh -smb <targetIP> <usernameList> <passwordList> <AttemptsPerLockoutPeriod> <LockoutPeriodInMinutes> <DOMAIN></p>
<h2>Mask Attack</h2>
    <p>A Mask Attack is similar to brute force attacks but recover passwords from hashes with a more specific set of characters based on information known to the attacker. The attacker uses a pattern of the password to narrow down the list of possible passwords and reduce the cracking time.</p>
    <p>Attacker use the <a target=_blank href=https://hashcat.net/hashcat/>Hashcat</a> tool to perform attacks such as brute force, dictionary and mask attacks. For a mask attack, the attacker must know the flags used for the built-in charset, custom charset and attack mode to create an appropriate pattern.</p>
<h2>Password Guessing</h2>  
<p>The attacker creates a list of all possible passwords and tries them manually on the target computer.
<ol><ul>Find a valid user</ul>
<ul>Create a list of possible passwords</ul>
<ul>Rank passwords from high to low probability</ul>
<ul>Key in each password until the correct password is discovered</ul>
</ol></p>
    <h2>Password guessing algorithm</h2>
<p>File credentials.txt</p>
    <code>
        administrator ""<br/>
        administrator password<br/>
        administrator administrator<br/>
        administrator password123<br/>
        etc.</code>
        <p>Command line example</p>
        <code>FOR /F "tokens=1,2*" %i in (credentials.txt)^<br/>
        More? do net use \\victim.com\IPC$ %j /u:victim.com\%i^<br/>
        More? 2>>nul^<br/>
        More? && echo %time% %date% >> outfile.txt^<br/>
        More? && echo \\victim.com acct: %i pass: %j >> outfile.txt<br/>
        c:\type outfile.txt</code>
        <p>The outfile.txt file contains the correct username and password, if the username and password in credentials.txt are correct. An attacker can establish an open session with the victim server using his/her system.</p>
<h2>Default passwords</h2>
<p>Default passwords are supplied by manufacturers and allow the user to access the device during initial setup. People often forget to set a new password after installation and continue using the original password. </p>
<p>Default passwords get a spot in the list of words or dictionary that the attacker uses to perform password-guessing attacks. Some on-line tools:
<ol>
<ul><a target=_blank href=https://open-sez.me>Open Sez Me!</a></ul>
    <ul><a target=_blank href=https://www.routerpasswords.com>Routerpasswords.com</a></ul>
    <ul><a target=_blank href=https://default-password.info>Default-password.info</a></ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Hash Injection / Pass-the-Hash (PtH)</h2>
<p>Hash values of credentials are generally stored in the SAM database/file on a Windows computer. Attackers get hold on the hash values and inject them in the authentication mechanism to authenticate with the user's stolen precomputed hash. 
In a hash injection / PtH attack, the attacker injects a compromised LanMan (LM) or NTLM hash into a local session. Any server or service using NTLM or LM authentication is suscpetible to this attack. </p>
<h2>LLMNR / NBT-NS poisoning</h2>
<p><a target=_blank href=https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder>Responder.py</a></p>
<h2>Internal Monologue Attack</h2>
<p>Similar to Mimikatz attack, except that the memory area of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process is not dumped, avoiding Windows Credential Guard and Antivirus. Attackers use 
<a target=_blank href=https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz>Mimikatz</a> to retrieve user credentials from LSASS process memory. An internal monologue attack is usually performed in a secure environment where Mimikatz cannot be executed. 
In this attack, using the Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) from a user-mode application, a local procedure call to the NTLM authentication package is invoked to calcluate the response.</p>
<h2>Cracking Kerberos passwords</h2>
<p><b>Kerberoasting</b>: cracking the TGS. In this attack, attacker request a TGS for the service principal name (SPN) of the target service account. The ticket is cracked to extract the service account password.</p>
<p><b>AS-REP Roasting</b>: cracking the TGT. Attackers request an authentication ticket (TGT) as an AS-REQ packet. Only possible when the user account is identified with the pre-authentication option disabled. The attacker stores the 
TGT offline and cracks it to extract the user account password.</p>
<h2>Pass-the-Ticket Attack</h2>
<p>Pass-the-ticket is a technique used for authenticating a user to a system that is using Kerberos tickets without providing the user's password. <b>Silver tickets</b> are captured for resources that use Kerberos for the authentication process, and can be 
used to create tickets to call a specific service and access the system that offers the service. <b>Golden tickets</b> are captured for the <b>DOMAIN</b> with the KDS KRBTGT NTLM hash that allows the creation of TGT's for any profile in the AD. Again, Mimikatz is used for this.</p>

    <h2>Combinator Attack</h2>
    <p>The entries of the first dictionary are combined with those from a second dictionary. A wordlist is created by merging entries of both dictionaries. Hashcat can be used to crack the password of the target user.
    Attackers use Combinator Attacks in a situation where a random phrase of words is used as a default password generation procedure.</p>
    <h2>Fingerprint Attack</h2>
    <p>Passphrase is broken down into fingerprints consisting of single- and multi-character combinations that a target user might choose as his/her password. For example, PASSWORD would create fingerprints "P", "A", "S", "S", "W", "O", "R", "D", 
    "PA", "SS", "WO", "RD", "PAS", "SWO" etc. Attackers usually perform this attack to crack complex passwords such as "pass-10". To perform this attack, attackers create a list of unique password hashes from a leaked password hash database, and then 
    perform a brute force attack to obtain a wordlist and further start the fingerprint attack.</p>
    <h2>PRINCE Attack</h2>
    <p>A PRobability INfinite Chained Elements (PRINCE) attack is an advanced version of a combinator attack in which, instead of taking inputs from two different dictionaries, attackers use a single input dictionary to build chains of combined words. 
    This chain can have between 1 and n words from the input dictionary concatenated together to form a chain of words. For example, if the length of characters to be guessed is 5, then the following combinations are created from the input dictionary:
    5 letter word<br/>
    3 letter word + 2 letter word<br/>
    2 letter word + 3 letter word<br/>
    1 letter word + 4 letter word etc.
</p>
    <h2>Toggle-Case Attack</h2>
    <p>In a Toggle Case attack, attackers try all possible upper-case and lower-case combinations of a word present in the input dictionary. If a word in the dictionary is "xyz", the following set of combinations is generated:
    <ol>
        <ul>xyz</ul>
        <ul>Xyz</ul>
        <ul>XYz</ul>
        <ul>XYZ</ul>
        <ul>xYz</ul>
        <ul>xyZ</ul>
        <ul>xYZ</ul>
    </p>
<p>The succes rate is low because of the fact users mostly use upper-case letters in the first position of a word or in between the word. In other cases, the user use a lower or equal number of upper-case letters than lower-case letters.</p>
<h2>Markov-Chain Attack</h2>
<p>Attackers gather a password database (LEAK) and split each password entry into two- and three character syllables (2-grams and 3-grams); a new alphabet is created which is then matched with the existing password database. 
This technique combines the selected letters into words with a maximum lenght of eight characters and then a dictionary attack is performed to crack the target password.</p>
<h2>GPU based Attack</h2>
<p>Graphics Processing Units (GPU) are circuits to display graphics, based on cross-platform APIs such as OpenGL that can be accessed by any application on the device with user-level credentials or permissions. 
Attackers perform social engineering to trick the victim into downloading a malicious program or application. The malicious program allows the attackers to secretly track user activities on the browser and perform side-channel 
leaks to steal passwords. Attackers can copy every character entered by the victim on the password field of the visited website. </p>
<h2>Passive Online Attacks</h2>
<h2>Wire Sniffing</h2>
<p>Sniffers gather packets at the data link layer and grab all the packets on the LAN of the machine running the sniffer program. The majority of sniffer tools are ideally suited to sniff data in a hub environment.</p>
<h2>Man-n-the-Middle and Replay Attacks</h2>
<p>A third party can eavesdrop on the traffic and pass it along. The Man-in-the-Middle has to sniff from both sides of the connection simultaneously and is often used in telnet and wireless technologies. In a Replay Attack 
packets and authentication tokens are captured using a sniffer. After the relevant info is extracted, the tokens are placed back on the network to gain access. The attacker uses this type of attack to replay bank transactions or similar types of data transfer, in the hope of replicating and/or altering activities, such 
as banking deposits or transfers.</p>

        <h2>Offline Attacks</h2>
        <p>Offline attacks occur when an attacker checks the validity of passwords. If usernames and passwords are stored in a readable file, it is easy for the attacker to gain access to the system. Offline attacks are often
        time-consuming but have a high success rate as the password hashes can be reversed owing to their small keyspace and short length.
        
        <ol>
        <ul>Rainbow table attack</ul>
        <ul>
        <li>uses cryptanalytic time-memory trade-off technique, which requires less time than other techniques.</li>
        <li>It uses already-calculated information stored in memory to crack the encryption</li>
        <li>The attacker creates a table of all the possible passwords and their respective hash values, known as a rainbow table, in advance</li>
