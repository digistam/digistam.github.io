<h1>Hacking OT</h1>
<p>Operational technology (OT) plays a major role in today's modern society, as it drives a collection of devices designed to work together as an integrated or homogeneous system. OT is a combination of hardware and 
  software that is used to monitor, run and control industrial process assets. These devices include switches, pumps, lights, sensors, surveillance cameras, elevators, robots, valves, cooling and heating systems.
  Any system that analyzes and processes operational data can be part of OT.</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Industrial Control Systems (ICSs)</ul>
    <ul>Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)</ul>
    <ul>Remote Terminal Units (RTU)</ul>
    <ul>Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC)</ul>
    <ul>Distributed Control Systems (DCS)</ul>
  </ol></p>

  <h2>Essential Terminology</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Assets -> different components of OT are generally referred to as assets</ul>
    <ul>Zones and Conduits -> network segregation technique used to isolate networks and assets to impose and maintain strong access control mechanisms</ul>
    <ul>Industrial Network and Business Network -> collection of automated control systems</ul>
    <ul>Industrial Protocols -> S7, CDA, SRTP, Modbus, OPC, DNP3, CIP etc.</ul>
    <ul>Network Perimeter / Electronic Security Perimeter -> outermost boundary of a network zone (closed group of assets)</ul>
    <ul>Critical Infrastructure -> collection of physical or logical systems and assets, the failure or destruction will severly impact security, safety, economy or public healts</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>IT/OT Convergence (IIOT)</h2>
  <p>IT/OT convergence is the integration of IT computing systems and OT operation monitoring systems. Bridging the gap between IT and OT can improve the overall business, producing faster and 
  efficient results. IT and OT teams are traditionally separated and are found in their respective domains. For instance, IT teams monitor internal processes and safeguard networks from cyber-attacks, 
  whereas OT teams ensure overall maintenance and management, including that of employees and industrial equipment.</p>

  <h2>Purdue Model</h2>
  <p>Derived from the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA) model, which is a widely used conceptual model that describes the internal connections and dependencies of important components in ICS networks.
  The Purdue Model consists of three zones:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Manufacturing Zone (OT)</ul>
    <ul>Enterprise Zone (IT)</ul>
    <ul>Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <p>The Enterprise security zone is part of IT, in which supply-chain management and scheduling are performed using business systems such as SAP and ERP. It also locates the data centers, users and cloud access.
  It has two levels:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Level 5 (Enterprise Network) -> B2B, B2C services, internet connectivity, inventory etc.</ul>
    <ul>Level 4 (Business Logistics Systems) -> all the IT systems supporting the production process in the plant lie at this level</ul>
  </ol>
  <p>The Manufacturing Zone contains the OT systems. All the devices, networks, control and monitoring systems reside in this zone. Four levels:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Level 3 (Operational Systems / Site Operations)</ul>
    <ul>Level 2 (Control Systems / Area Supervisory Controls)</ul>
    <ul>Level 1 (Basic Controls / Intelligent Devices)</ul>
    <ul>Level 0 (Physical Process)</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Challenges of OT</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Lack of visibility -> having no clear cybersecurity visibility</ul>
    <ul>Plain-text passwords</ul>
    <ul>Network complexity</ul>
    <ul>Legacy technology</ul>
    <ul>Lack of antivirus protection</ul>
    <ul>Lack of skilled security professionals</ul>
    <ul>Rapid pace of change</ul>
    <ul>Outdated systems</ul>
    <ul>Haphazard modernization (updating the system can take several years)</ul>
    <ul>Insecure connections</ul>
    <ul>Usage of rogue devices</ul>
    <ul>Convergence with IT (IT security team does not have much experience with OT systems)</ul>
    <ul>Organizational challenges</ul>
    <ul>Unique production networks / proprietary software</ul>
    <ul>Vulnerable communication protocols</ul>
    <ul>Remote management protocols</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h1>Industrial Control System (ICS)</h1>
  <p>ICS is an essential part of every industrial process and critical infrastructure. A typical ICS represents the information system that controls and supports all types of industrial processes, such as 
  production, manufacturing, product handling, distribution etc. An ICS comprises several types of control systems, such as SCADA, DCS, BPC, Safety Instrumentation Systems (SIS), HMI etc. This technology 
  consists of various components such as sensors, controllers and actuators (mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic etc.) that act collectively to achieve and industrial objective. The operation of ICS 
  can be configured in three modes:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Open Loop (output of system depends on the preconfigured settings)</ul>
    <ul>Closed Loop (output always has an effect on the input to acquire the desired objective)</ul>
    <ul>Manual Loop (system totally under control of humans)</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Components of an ICS</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Distributed Control System (DCS) -> highly engineered and large-scale control system used to perform industry-specific task</ul>
    <ul>Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) -> centralized supervisory control system used for controlling and monitoring industrial facilities and infrastructure</ul>
    <ul>Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) -> digital solid-state computer used for industrial automation, built to survive severe industrial environments</ul>
    <ul>Basic Process Control System (BPCS) -> system that responds to input signals from processes and associated equipment; act as first layer of protection agains any unsafe or hazardous condition to the 
    equipment</ul>
    <ul>Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) -> automated control system designed to safeguard the manufacturing environment in case of any hazardous incident; it consists of sensors, logic solvers and final 
    control elements</ul>
  </ol></p>
