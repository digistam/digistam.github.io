<h1>Wireless Hacking Methodology</h1>
<p>When hacking wireless networks, an attacker follows a methodology involving systematic steps to perform a successful attack on a target wireless network. The methodology helps an attacker reach the goal of hacking 
    a target wireless network. A methodology helps to be sure of finding every single-entry point to break into the target network. The objective of the wireless hacking methodology is to compromise a Wi-Fi network 
in order to gain unauthorized access to network resources. Attackers use the following steps:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Wi-Fi discovery</ul>
        <ul>GPS mapping</ul>
        <ul>Wireless traffic analysis</ul>
        <ul>Launch of wireless attacks</ul>
        <ul>Wi-Fi encryption cracking</ul>
        <ul>Wi-Fi network compromising</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h1>Wi-Fi Discovery</h1>
    <p>The first step is to find a Wi-Fi network or device. An attacker performs Wi-Fi discovery to locate a target wireless network using tools such as <a target=_blank href=https://www.metageek.com/inssider/>inSSIDer</a>, 
   <a target=_blank href=https://nutsaboutnets.com/archives/netsurveyor-wifi-scanner/>NetSurveyor</a> etc. Wi-Fi discovery procedures include footprinting the wireless networks and finding the appropriate target network 
    that is in range to launch an attack. </p>
    <h2>Wireless Network Footprinting</h2>
    <p>An attack on a wireless network begins with its discovery and footprinting. Footprinting involves locating and analyzing (or understanding) the network. To footprint a wireless network, an attacker needs to
    identify the <b>BSS</b> provided by the AP. An attacker may identify the BSS or independent BSS (IBSS) with the help of the SSID of the wireless network. Therefore, the attacker needs to determine the SSID of the 
    target wireless network, which can be used to establish an association with an AP to compromise its security.</p>
    <p>An attacker can use the following two footprinting methods to detect the SSID of a wireless network:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul><b>Passive</b> Footprinting Method: detecting the existence of an AP by sniffing the packets from airwaves</ul>
        <ul><b>Active</b> Footprinting Method: the attacker's wireless device sends a probe request with the SSID to an AP and waits for a response; if the wireless device does not have the SSID in advance, it can 
        send a probe request with an empty SSID</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>In the case of a probe request with an empty SSID, most APs respons with their own SSID in a probe response packet; consequently, emtpy SSIDs are useful in learning the SSIDs of APs. In this method, the 
    attacker knows the correct BSS to associate with and can configure the AP to ignore a probe request with an empty SSID.</p>
    <p>An attacker can scan for Wi-Fi networks with the help of wireless network scanning tools such as <a target=_blank href=https://nutsaboutnets.com/archives/netsurveyor-wifi-scanner/>NetSurveyor</a> and 
        <a target=_blank href=https://lizardsystems.com/wi-fi-scanner/>Wi-Fi Scanner</a>.</p>
        <p>The SSID is present in beacons, probe requests and responses as well as in association and re-association requests. An attacker can obtain the SSID through passive scanning, if that fails the attacker 
        can detect it through active scanning. Subsequently, the attacker can connect to the wireless network and launch attacks. Wireless network scanning allows sniffing by tuning into various channels of the 
        devices.</p>

    <h2>Finding Wi-Fi Networks in Range to Attack</h2>
    <p>The first task for an attacker searching for Wi-Fi targets is to check potential networks that are in range to find the best one to attack. Attackers use various Wi-Fi chalking techniques such as WarWalking, 
    WarChalking, WarFlying and WarDriving to find a target Wi-Fi network.</p>
    <h2>Wi-Fi Chalking Techniques</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>WarWalking: walk around with Wi-Fi enabled laptops installed with a wireless discovery tool to map out open wireless networks</ul>
        <ul>WarChalking: symbols drawn in public places to advertise open Wi-Fi networks</ul>
        <ul>WarFlying: using drones to detect open wireless networks</ul>
        <ul>WarDriving: driving around with Wi-Fi enabled laptops installed with a wireless discovery tool to map out open wireless networks</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>Attackers use the following tools to discover Wi-Fi networks for launching attacks:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Laptop with a Wi-Fi card</ul>
        <ul>External Wi-Fi antenna</ul>
        <ul>Network discovery software</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>Some of the tools used to discover Wi-Fi networks in range to attack are <a target=_blank href=https://www.metageek.com/inssider/>inSSIDer</a>, 
        <a target=_blank href=https://nutsaboutnets.com/archives/netsurveyor-wifi-scanner/>NetSurveyor</a>, 
        <a target=_blank href=https://lizardsystems.com/wi-fi-scanner/>Wi-Fi Scanner</a> and 
        <a target=_blank href=https://www.acrylicwifi.com/en/>Acrylic Wi-Fi Home</a>.</p>

    <h2>Finding WPS-Enabled APs</h2>
    <p>Attackers use the <a target=_blank href=https://en.kali.tools/?p=341>Wash commandline utility</a> to identify WPS-enabled APs in the target wireless network. This utility also helps attackers 
    check whether the AP is in a locked state. Most WPS-enabled routers are locket automatically when incorrect credentials are entered more than 5 times consecutively, and they can be unlocked only in the 
    administrator interface of the router manually. The Wash command supports the 5Ghz channel and can be used by installing the Reaver package. Some arguments used by attackers:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>-i, --interface</ul>
        <ul>-a, --all (all access points, including those with WPS disabled</ul>
        <ul>-f, --file (reads packets from captured files)</ul>
        <ul>-c, --channel (channel to listen to)</ul>
        <ul>-o, --out-file (writes data to file)</ul>
        <ul>-n, --probes (maximum number of probes to send to each AP in the scan mode)</ul>
        <ul>-D, --daemonize (Wash command)</ul>
        <ul>-5, --5ghz</ul>
        <ul>-s, --scan</ul>
        <ul>-u, --survey</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>Attackers use the following command to discover the access point, extended service set identifier (ESSID) and BSSID of a device or router:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>sudo wash -i wlan0</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h1>GPS Mapping</h1>
    <p>The second step in the wireless hacking methodology is GPS mapping. An attacker who discovers a target wireless network can proceed toward wireless hacking by drawing a map of the network. In this step, 
    the attacker may use various automated tools to map the target wireless network. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based satellite navigation system that provides the location of physical 
    entities on Earth, along with the time when they were present at that location. Using a GPS utility, anyone can find a specific location on Earth and its geographical features. An attacker uses this GPS 
    utility to locate and map the target wireless network in a particular geographical area.</p>
    <p>A GPS receiver calculates position, time and velocity by processing specifically coded satellite signals. Attackers know that the presence of free Wi-Fi networks in an area may indicate the existence 
    of an unsecured network. Attackers usually create maps of discovered Wi-Fi networks and a database with statistics collected using Wi-Fi discovery tools such as inSSIDer Office and NetSurveyor. GPS is 
    useful in tracking the location of discovered Wi-Fi networks and the coordinates uploaded to sites such as <a target=_blank href=https://wigle.net>WiGLE</a>. Attackers can share such information with the
    hacking community or sell it for profit.</p>
    <p><a target=_blank href=https://wigle.net>WiGLE</a> consolidates information on wireless networks worldwide, including their locations, in a central database, and it provides user-friendly Java, Windows
    and web applications that can map, query and update the database via the web. A wireless network can be added to WiGLE from a stumble file or manually, and remarks can be added to existing networks.</p>
    <p>The location of discovered Wi-Fi networks can be tracked using WiGLE through the following steps:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Navigate to <a target=_blank href=https://wigle.net>wigle.net</a> and click on <b>Uploads</b></ul>
        <ul>In the <b>Uploads</b> page, click on <b>UPLOAD A FILE</b> to upload a log file</ul>
        <ul>A pop-up window will appear, showing the types of files supported for upload</ul>
        <ul>Click on <b>Choose File</b>; select Wi-Fi discovery tools and then the log file to upload</ul>
        <ul>Click on <b>Send</b></ul>
        <ul>WiGLE then shows complete information on the location of the Wi-Fi networks</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>WiGLE currently supports DStumbler, G-Mon, inSSIDer, KisMAC, Kismet, MacStumbler, NetStumbler, Pocket Warrior, Wardrive-Android, WiFiFoFum, WiFi-Where, WiGLE WiFi Wardriving and Apple consolidated 
    DB formats.</p>

    <h2>Wi-Fi Network Discovery Through WarDriving</h2>
    <p>WarDriving can be used to discover Wi-Fi networks with the following procedure:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Register with WiGLE and download map packs of the target area to view the plotted APs on a map</ul>
        <ul>Connect the laptop to an antenna and a GPS device via a USB serial adapter and board a car</ul>
        <ul>Install and launch NetStumbler and WiGLE client software and turn on the GPS device</ul>
        <ul>Drive the car at speeds of 35 mph or below (at higher speeds, the Wi-Fi antenna will not be able to detect Wi-Fi networks)</ul>
        <ul>Capture and save the NetStumbler log files that contain the GPS coordinates of the APs</ul>
        <ul>Upload this log file to WiGLE, which automatically plots the points on a map</ul>
    </ol></p>
