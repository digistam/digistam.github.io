<h1>APT</h1>
<p><a target=_blank href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat>Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)</a> is a major security concern for any organization. Recently in the news it was revealed that a member of an “APT” group that utilises the “Conti” ransomware became disgruntled 
    at the state of their relationship with the group and leaked a large majority of the groups “Tools, Techniques and Procedures” documents. Conti was first discovered in 2020 and is used primarily by the 
    Russian crime group aliased as “Wizard Spider” (we will assume the leak came from a former member of this group). In addition to the encryption of files seen from historical families of ransomware, 
    Conti also copies files to the attacker’s server before encryption, allowing the group to threaten data leaks if the ransom isn’t paid. </p>
    <h2>What is it</h2>
    <p>An APT is defined as a type of network attack, whereby the attacker gain unauthorized access to a target network and remains there undetected for a long time. <b>Advanced</b>: techniques to exploit underlying vulnerabilities, <b>persistent</b>: external command & conquer (C&C) system continuously extracting data and monitoring the victim's network,
    <b>threat</b>: human involvement in coordination.</p>
    <p>APT attacks are highly sophisticated attacks whereby an attacker uses well-crafted malicious code along with a combination of <b>multiple zero-day exploits</b> to gain access to the target network. Attacks involve well planned
     and coordinated techniques whereby attackers erase evidence of their malicious activities after their objectives have been fulfilled.</p>
    <h2>Victims</h2>
    <p>APT attacks are usually performed on organizations related to financial, healthcare, defense, aerospace etc. Main goal is to obtain sensitive information, like:
    <ol>
        <ul>classified documents</ul>
        <ul>user credentials</ul>
        <ul>employee's or customer's personal information</ul>
        <ul>network information</ul>
        <ul>transaction information</ul>
        <ul>credit card information</ul>
        <ul>organization's business strategy informaton</ul>
        <ul>control system access information</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul><b>Objectives</b>: repeatedly obtain sensitive information for illegal earnings / spying for political or strategic goals</ul>
        <ul><b>Timeliness</b>: time taken by attacker from assessing the target system for vulnerabilities to exploiting them to gain and maintain access</ul>
        <ul><b>Resources</b>: amount of knowledge, tools and techniques required to perform an attack. APT attacks are more sophisticated attacks performed by <a target=_blank href=https://attack.mitre.org/groups/>highly skilled cybercriminals</a> with considerable resources</ul>
        <ul><b>Risk tolerance</b>: level up to which the attack remains undetected in the target network</ul>
        <ul><b>Skills and methods</b>: various social engineering techniques to gather information, techniques to prevent detection by security mechanisms and techniques to maintain access for a long time</ul>
        <ul><b>Actions</b>: technical actions to maintain presence in the victim's network for a long time and extract as much data as possible</ul>
        <ul><b>Attack originating points</b>: numerous attempts made to gain entry into the network, the attacker needs to conduct exhaustive research to identify vulnerabilities and gatekeeper functions in the target network</ul>
        <ul><b>Numbers involved in the attack</b>: number of hosts involved in the attack, usually performed by a crime group / organization</ul>
        <ul><b>Knowledge source</b>: gathering of information through online sources about specific threats which can be further exploited to perform certain attacks</ul>
        <ul><b>Multi phased</b>: reconnaissance, access, discovery, capture, data exfiltration</ul>
        <ul><b>Tailored to the vulnerabilities</b>: malicious code is designed and written such that it targets the specific vulnerabilities present in the victim's network</ul>
        <ul><b>Multiple points of entries</b>: in the initial phase of an APT attack the adversary creates multiple points of entry to maintain access, if one point is detected a different entry point can be used</ul>
        <ul><b>Evading signature based detection systems</b>: APT attacks are closely related to zero-day exploits, APT attacks can easily bypass security mechanisms </ul>
        <ul><b>Specific Warning Signs</b>: APT attacks are usually impossible to detect, warning signs are: presence of a backdoor Trojan for maintaining access, unusual file transfers, unusual database activities etc.</ul>
    </ol></p>
<h2>APT Lifecycle</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul><b>Preparation</b>: adversary defines target, performs extensive research, organizes a team, build tools and perform tests</ul>
    <ul><b>Initial Intrusion</b>: sending spear-phishing emails, exploiting vulnerabilities on publicly available servers, sometimes social engineering techniques, malicious code or malware is deployed to initiate an outbound connection</ul>
    <ul><b>Expansion</b>: the primary objectives of this phase are expanding access to the target network and obtaining credentials. In most cases the objective of an attacker is to access multiple systems using a single compromised system. The attacker wants to obtain administrative login credentials to escalate privileges and gain further access to the systems in the network</ul>
    <ul><b>Persistence</b>: maintaining access to the target system, evading endpoint security devices like IDS and firewalls, finding locations for installing malware that are not frequently examined, including routers, servers, firewalls, printers etc.</ul>
    <ul><b>Search and exfiltration</b>: gaining access to a resource that can be used for performing further attacks or using that resource for financial gain</ul>
    <ul><b>Cleanup</b>: prevent detection and remove evidence of compromise / make the system appear as it was before they gained access</ul>
</ol></p>
