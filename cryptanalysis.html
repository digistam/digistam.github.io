<h1>Cryptanalysis</h1>
<p>Cryptanalysis is the study of ciphers, ciphertext or cryptosystems with the ability to identify 
  vulnerabilities in them and thus extract plaintext from ciphertexts even if the cryptographic key 
  or algorithm used to encrypt the plaintext is unknown.
  <h2>Linear cryptanalysis</h2>
  <p>Linear cryptanalysis is based on finding affine approximations to the action of a cipher. 
  It is commonly used on block ciphers. It is a known plaintext attack. Given sufficient pairs of 
  plaintext and corresponding ciphertext, bits of information about the key can be obtained.</p>
