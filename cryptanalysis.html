<h1>Cryptanalysis</h1>
<p>Cryptanalysis is the study of ciphers, ciphertext or cryptosystems with the ability to identify 
  vulnerabilities in them and thus extract plaintext from ciphertexts even if the cryptographic key 
  or algorithm used to encrypt the plaintext is unknown.
  <h2>Linear cryptanalysis</h2>
  <p>Linear cryptanalysis is based on finding affine approximations to the action of a cipher. 
  It is commonly used on block ciphers. It is a known plaintext attack. Given sufficient pairs of 
  plaintext and corresponding ciphertext, bits of information about the key can be obtained.</p>
  <p>Obviously, the more pairs of plaintext and ciphertext one has, the greater are the chances 
  of success.</p>
<h2>Differential cryptanalysis</h2>
<p>Differential cryptanalysis is a form of cryptanalysis applicable to symmetric key algorithms.
Essentially, it is the examination of differences in input and how that affects the resultant
difference in the output. It originally worked only with chosen plaintext. It can also work 
with known plaintext and ciphertext.</p>
<h2>Integral cryptanalysis</h2>
<p>This attack is particularly useful agains block ciphers based on substitution - permutation 
networks as an extension of differential cryptanalysis. The differential analysis looks at pairs 
of inputs that differ in only one bit position, with all the other bits being identical.</p>
<h2>Quantum cryptanalysis</h2>
<p>Quantum cryptanalysis is the process of cracking cryptographic algorithms using a quantum 
computer. Attackers must obtain the encrypted content, and the process requires significant 
time and quantum resources.</p>
