<h2>Brute Force</h2>
<p>Brute force attacks, or exhaustive attacks, determine the keys by trying every possible 
combination of characters. The efficiency depends on the hardware configured. The use of 
faster processors means that more keys will be tested per second. Cryptanalysts carried out 
a succesful brute force attack on a DES encryption method, which effectively rendered DES 
obsolete.</p>
