<h1>Code breaking methodologies</h1>
<h2>Brute Force</h2>
<p>Brute force attacks, or exhaustive attacks, determine the keys by trying every possible 
combination of characters. The efficiency depends on the hardware configured. The use of 
faster processors means that more keys will be tested per second. Cryptanalysts carried out 
a succesful brute force attack on a DES encryption method, which effectively rendered DES 
obsolete.</p>
  <p>It is extremely difficult to crack cryptographic systems, as they have no practival weaknesses to exploit; however, it is not impossible. Cryptographic systems use cryptographic algorithms to encrypt a message. 
  These cryptographic algorithms use a key to encrypt or decrypt messages. In cryptography, this key is the important parameter that specifies the transformation of plaintext to ciphertext and vice versa. If you 
  are able to guess or find the key used for decryption, then you can decrypt the messages and read them in clear text. 128-bit keys are common and considered strong. From a security perspective, to avoid guessing 
  the key, cryptographic systems use randomly generated keys. However, you still have a choice to determine the key used for encryption or decryption.</p>
  <p>You can attempt to decrypt a message using all possible keys until you discover the key used for encryption. This method of discovering is called brute force attack. Doing so requires a massive amount of 
  processing power. It is resource intensive and time intensive. The average time needed to find the key in a brute-force attack depends on the length of the key. How longer the key, how longer it takes to brute force
  attack it. Difficulty depends on:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Length of the key</ul>
    <ul>Number of possible values each component of the key can have</ul>
    <ul>Time it takes to attempt each key</ul>
    <ul>If there is any mechanism that locks the attacker out after a certain number of failed attempts</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Frequency Analysis</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Study of frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext</ul>
    <ul>In any given stretch of written language, certain letters and combinations of letters occur with varying frequencies</ul>
    <ul>This technique examines the number of times that a particular symbol appears in a ciphertext</ul>
    <ul>Example: the letter <b>e</b> is a common letter in the English language; If the letter <b>k</b> appears commonly in a ciphertext, it can be reasonably concluded that <b>k</b>
    in the encrypted language is equivalent to <b>e</b> in English</ul>
    <ul>Encrypted <b>source code</b> is more vulnerable to these types of attacks because words such as #define, struct, else and return are repeated frequently in code</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Trickery and Deceit</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Requires high level of mathematical and cryptographic skills</ul>
    <ul>Social engineering</ul>
    <ul>It is fairly easy to decrypt an entire message if the user knows some of its content</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>One-Time Pad</h2>
  <p>One can crack any cipher if provided with sufficient time and resources. An exception is One-Time Pad, which is assumed unbreakable even with infinite resources. A one-time pad mostly contains 
  a non-repeating set of letters or numbers, chosed by the system randomly. The user writes them on small sheets of paper and then pastes them together in a pad. The sender encrypts only one plaintext
  character using each key letter on the pad, and the receiver decrypts each letter of the ciphertext using an identical pad. Once the letter uses a page, he tears it off the pad and securely discards it; 
  hence the name one-time pad. A drawback is that the key length is the same as that of the message, thus making it impossible to encrypt and send large messages.</p>
