<h1>Communications Models</h1>
<p>We access systems through their addresses. Each system has multiple addresses. These addresses are separated into <b>buckets</b> related to the functionality provided by the protocol each address belongs to.</p>
  <p>Communication Models are broken into layers, the layers are stacked on top of one another. Often they are referred to as <b>network stacks</b> or <b>protocol stacks</b>. It is important to consider that all the 
  layers are all separate and the functionality is distinct. When two systems are talking to each other, each has these notional layers. Layer C of machine 1 can only talk to layer C of machine 2 etc. This is 
  because the protocol at layer C on both systems match. The same is true for other protocols.</p>
<h2>Protocols</h2>
  <p>Start Wireshark and do some capture with eth0. Wireshark will show captured frames containing protocols (for example: Internet Protocol Version 4, User Datagram Protocol, Simple Service Discovery Protocol).</p>
<p>A protocol is a set of rules or conventions that dictate communication. Dissecting the functions of network communications into layers means the functions are modulized. This means that it can be easy to 
extract one protocol from the chain and insert into another. This works because the functionality of each layer is abstracted, meaning layers can communicate with each other without needing to known the details
because the functionality is known. The individual protocols don't matter, necessarily.</p>
<h2>OSI - Open Systems Interconnection</h2>
<p>The OSI model contains seven layers:</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Application (Layer 7) -> closest to the end users (NOT the application itself, but the PROTOCOLS); Example: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</ul>
  <ul>Presentation (Layer 6) -> responsible for preparing data for the application itself; when systems are communicating there may be disconnects in formatting between the two endpoints, the presentation 
  layer makes sure the data is correctly formatted; Example: ASCII, Unicode, JPEG</ul>
  <ul>Session (Layer 5) -> manages the communication between the two endpoints when it comes to maintaining the communication of applications; Example: Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), components of file sharing services</ul>
  <ul>Transport (Layer 4) -> takes care of segmenting messages for transmission as well as multiplexing of the communication; Example: TCP, UDP</ul>
  <ul>Network (Layer 3) -> gets messages from one endpoint to another, taking care of addressing and routing; Example: IP</ul>
  <ul>Data Link (Layer 2) -> media access control (MAC), identifying the network interface on the network so communications can get from one system to another on the local network; Example: ARP (Address Resolution 
  Protocol), virtual local networks (VLANs), Ethernet</ul>
  <ul>Physical (Layer 1) -> all the protocols that manage the physical communications, dictating how the pulses on the wire are handled; Example: 10BaseT, 100BaseTX</ul>
</ol></p>
  <p>One of the problems with the OSI model is that there not always good fits when it comes to mapping protocols to the seven layers. The problem often comes in the areas between the Session and Application Layers. 
  At which layer does SSH protocol live ? It handles sessions, or is it in the application layer because it includes encryption mechanisms and negotiates them ?</p>
  <h2>TCP/IP Architecture</h2>
  <p>The TCP/IP architecture (sometimes called model) is a much simpler design than the OSI model. It only has four layers:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Application</ul>
    <ul>Transport</ul>
    <ul>Internet</ul>
    <ul>Link</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <p>Regardless of which model you prefer to think about networking in, protocols don't generally sprawl across multiple layers. They are designed to fill the requirements of a specific function, which will 
  land pretty squarely into one of the layers of each model.</p>
  <h1>Physical networking</h1>
  <p>Each layer of the network stack has a different term to refer to the chunk of data encapsulated by that layer. These chunks are called <b>protocol data units (PDUs)</b>. The PDU at Layer 2, is a <b>frame</b>. 
  When you are looking at a chunk of data with the physical address in it, you are looking at a frame (Wireshark will also show it as a "frame").</p>
  <h2>Addressing</h2>
  <p>Ethernet interfaces all have addresses. These addresses are exclusive to each network interface and they are called MAC addresses. MAC addresses are hard coded into the hardware of the interface, it is 
  sometimes referred to as the <b>hardware address</b>. Since it's also the address that is used by a physical piece of hardware, it is sometimes referred to as a <b>physical address</b>. Common format is 
  6 octets (8 bit bytes) separated by colons (BA:00:4C:78:75:57). First part is the Vendor ID / organizationally unique identifier (UOI). Second half is the unique ID for the card itself.</p>
  <h2>Switching</h2>
  <p>MAC addresses are the cornerstone for switching. Switching is what happens when decisions about forwarding messages are based on the physical address. A switch is really a multiport bridge. A bridge 
  connects two networks together. What a switch does is make determinations about what traffic goes to which port based on the destination MAC address.</p>
  <h2>IP</h2>
  <p>Moving into the Network layer, we run across IP. As each layer is passed trough, a set of data is added to the message that is specific to the protocol processing the message. These sets of data are 
  called <b>headers</b>. Each protocol has its own set of headers that get attached. The message is then encapsulated by the headers, creating an entirely new PDU. For IP, the PDU is called a <b>packet</b>. IP 
  is considered a <b>best effort</b> protocol. It does its best to get packets from the source to the destination. It does nothing to absolutely ensure that they get there. It does facilitate the 
  transmissions, however, by providing addressing.</p>
  <h2>Headers</h2>
  <p>When looking at the <b>Internet Protocol</b> in a Wireshark Frame you will see header fields:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Version -> 4, 6 (4-bit field)</ul>
    <ul>Header Length -> most common is 20 bytes</ul>
    <ul>Type of Service -> ToS, referred to as Differentiated Services Field; helps network elements to make QoS decisions by prioritizing some messages and deprioritizing others</ul>
    <ul>Total Length -> max. 65.535 octets (bytes)</ul>
    <ul>Identification -> sometimes there is too much data beingt sent to fit into the maximum length allowed based on the size of the length field. This means that sometimes the messages need to be 
    fragmented; all fragments will have the same identification value</ul>
    <ul>Flags -> 3 bits allocated to a flags field. One is reserved and the second indicates whether the message can be fragmented (DF bit). The last bit is used to indicate whether there are additional 
    fragments</ul>
    <ul>Fragment Offset -> 13 bits long, indicates where the data in the packet aligns, to let the receiving system known how to stitch all the fragments together</ul>
    <ul>Time to Live -> TTL, indicates how long a message can live on the network before it is considered to be expired; Once the field hits 0, the message is discarded and an error message is returned to the sender</ul>
    <ul>Protocol -> tells the receiving system what headers to look for in the transport header</ul>
    <ul>Checksum -> 16 bit value to determine whether the header is intact</ul>
    <ul>Source Address -> IPv4 address that sent the message</ul>
    <ul>Destination Address -> IPv4 address the message is going to</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <p>IPv4 addresses are 4 octets (bytes) long. They are commonly shown as being separated by a period (.) and are sometimes referred to as <b>dotted quads</b> or <b>dotted decimal</b>. 
  Since each value is 8 bits, there are potential values of 0 to 255. The address range 127.0.0.1 - 127.255.255.255 is reserved for loopback addresses. The loopback interface ensures there is always a 
  network interface on the system and allows for testing over a network without sending any traffic outside the system. Commonly the loopback address on systems is 127.0.0.1 though any address in that 
  range could be used.</p>
  <p>RFC 1918 defines ranges of IP addresses that are used for private networks. These addresses are not routable over the internet. Most networks will do something to block source addresses from these 
  ranges coming into their space, since they should never be originating from the outside of a network:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255</ul>
    <ul>172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255</ul>
    <ul>192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h1>Subnets</h1>
  <p>IP addresses are aggregated into networks using contiguous addresses. This makes routing to those addresses easier since routing tables don't have to keep track of every single IP address. 
  The subnet mask is 32 bits in length and represented as a dotted quad. To determine what portion of an IP address belongs to the network, you look at the bits that are set to 1 in the subnet mask.</p>
  <p>1111 1111.1111 1111.1111 1111.1000 0000</p>
  <p>In this example: any bit position that has a 1 in it is part of the network segment. As a result, subnet masks can have only certain values: 0, 128, 192, 224, 240, 248, 252, 254 and 255. 
  This is because every position is a power of two and we add on from the most significant bit on the left side. The <a target=_blank href=https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-decimal.html?x=10000000>binary 10000000</a>
  equals to 128 in decimal. 11000000 is 192. Every time we set a bit to 1, we add on the next lower power of 2. </p>
 <p>11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000 = 255.255.255.128</p>
 <p>With a subnet mask of 255.255.255.128 we have the possibility of two address blocks, regardless of what the IP address is, we can only vary the last octet. In this case, we can't change the value in the 
 most significant bit position. This leaves us with the ranges 0 - 127 and 128 - 255. Once we known what the IP address is, we known in which block we are. Let's say the IP address is 172.20.30.42 and the network 
 mask is 255.255.255.128. We can see the address block has to be 172.20.30.0 because that's the range .42 lands in.</p>
    <h2>CIDR</h2>
    <p>Another way to designate network blocks is using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. You only get the number of prefix bits. Example: 172.20.30.42/25. Using this notation actually make life 
    a little easier if you think about it in powers of two. Often, you see CIDR notations hovering around the /24 area, which is the 255.255.255.0 subnet and is common. If you want to known how many hosts, you 
    just divide by 2 or multiply by 2 for every bit change in the prefix. A network that is in /24 has 256 possible values in the host portion (the last octet). If you go to a /25 than you get 128 possible values 
    (divide by 2 because you added a prefix bit, meaning you lost a host bit). If you go to the other direction /23, you double by 2 because you lost a prefix bit, meaning it got added to the host portion. Instead 
    of 256 you now have 512 possible values in the host portion. </p>
    <p>There are two values that can't be used for systems. The lowest possible address in any network segment is used for the network. The highest possible address in any network segment is used for the 
    broadcast address. In a common /24 network, the .0 becomes the network address and the .255 is used for the broadcast. Neither of these can be allocated for hosts. </p>
<h1>TCP</h1>
<p>Moving to the Transport Layer, we first run across the TCP. Where IP is a best-effort protocol, TCP is said to have guaranteed delivery. There are mechanisms in the protocol that keep track of all the 
messages that are sent and if something goes wrong, messages will be re-sent. The PDU for TCP is <b>segment</b>. </p>
<p>Transport layer protocols provide <b>ports</b> as a way of addressing. We can look at the headers from a packet capture:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Source Port -> port the traffic originated from on the sending side, very important because conversations are not one way. For the recipient to be able to respond, it needs a port to send back on. When messages 
    are responded to, the source and destination ports are reversed</ul>
    <ul>Destination Port -> destination port is the one that is associated with an application. Every conversation has a client side and a server side. The server side binds an application to a listening port. The 
    client sends to this port as the destination port</ul>
    <ul>Sequence Number -> contributes to the guaranteed delivery. This is a 32 bit number that is set to a random value when the conversation is initiated. It is incremented with the number of bytes that are sent. 
    Using the sequence number, the sender tells the recipient where in the conversation this message falls</ul>
    <ul>Acknowledgement Number -> opposite side of the conversation from the sequence number. Where the sequence number is set from the sender, the acknowledgement number is set from the recipient. The acknowledgement 
    number is set to the next byte number the recipient expects to receive. In practice, this means that the byte count is incremented by 1 and then sent. </ul>
    <ul>Data Offset -> lets the system known where to look for the data, necessary because the TCP header can be variable length</ul>
    <ul>Reserved</ul>
    <ul>Control Bits -> there are 6 flag bits that are used to indicate disposition of the message</ul>
    <ul>The SYN flag is the synchronize flag, indicating that the sequence number is set and should be recorded</ul>
    <ul>The ACK flag is the same for the acknowledgement number</ul>
    <ul>The URG flag indicates that the urgent pointer has data that is significant</ul>
    <ul>The PSH flag is an indication that the data should be pushed up rather than being buffered</ul>
    <ul>The RST flag resets the connection, which may happen when a message is received that appears to be in error</ul>
    <ul>The FIN flag indicates that the conversation is over and there is no more data to send</ul>
    <ul>Window -> tells the receiver how many bytes the sender is willing to accept</ul>
    <ul>Checksum -> used to ensure that the communication has not been corrupted</ul>
    <ul>Urgent Pointer -> indicates the next byte value after the urgent data, aligns with the sequence number values</ul>
    <ul>Options -> variable length</ul>
</ol></p>
    <h2>Three-way handshake</h2>
    <p>The handshake ensures that both sides of the conversation are alive an active because they are expected to respond. The first message in the three-way handshake is the <b>SYN</b> message. The SYN flag is 
    set, as well as the initial sequence number, which is a random value. The response to the SYN message is an acknowledgement message. This sets the ACK flag and increments the initial sequence number by one, 
    indicating the first message was received. In the same segment, the SYN flag and sequence number are also set. Keep in mind that the conversation is two-way, so both sides have to keep track of where they 
    are in the conversation. Each side keeps track of a sequence number for their side and an acknowledgement number for the other side. The final message in the handshake is one that just has the ACK flag set, 
    and the acknowledgement field increments the sequence number in the SYN/ACK message.</p>
    <p>Not every application needs the guaranteed delivery model that TCP provides.</p>
    <h1>UDP</h1>
    <p>UDP offers another mode of transport that doesn't have the same overhead that TCP has. It's a much lighter-weight protocol that offers no guarantee of delivery. It also doesn't much matter which order 
    messages are received in from the standpoint of the protocol. If the application is interested in those sorts of details, it can take care of the management.</p>
    <p>UDP has four header fields. Half of them are the source and destination ports. The source port is considered an optional field. Since there is no connection, there may never be a response from the server. 
    A source port is required with TCP because there will always be a reply, even if it's just to complete the three-way handshake. The RFC for UDP does not define a response to a closed UDP port. Working with 
    UDP ports is entirely unreliable. It is good for applications that require fast setup and transmission. Streaming audio and video work well with UDP, and don't work well with TCP. Realtime protocols 
    are less concerned about correct order, so they use UDP.</p>

    <h1>Internet Control Message Protocol</h1>
    <p>ICMP is a special case when it comes to protocols. It doesn't carry user data. Instead, it works with other protocols to provide error and control messaging. When something unexpected happens on the 
    network, devices will generate ICMP messages to send back to the originating device to let them known that there was a problem. It does sit on the top of IP, because it needs the addressing of IP, but it is 
    considered to be part of the Internet Layer as IP is. It makes it a bit unusual, because it sort of sits above the Network Layer but isn't a Transport Layer protocol. ICMP is used by the Ping program. 
    You may also use the Traceroute program to get the network route to a destination. The traceroute program relies on two ICMP messages. The first is ICMP type 11, which is time exceeded in transit. This 
    means that the message's TTL field got decremented to zero. When the traceroute completes, the program expects to get an ICMP type 3, destination unreachable.</p>
