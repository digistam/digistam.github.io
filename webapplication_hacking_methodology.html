<h1>Web Application Hacking Methodology</h1>
<p>Attackers use the web application hacking methodology to gain knowledge of a particular web application to compromise it succesfully. This methodology allows them to plan each step in detail 
to increase their chances of successfully hacking the application. Under this methodology, they do the following to collect detailed information about various resources  needed to run or access the 
web application:</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>Footprint web infrastructure</ul>
 <ul>Analyze web applications</ul>
 <ul>Bypass client-side controls</ul>
 <ul>Attack authentication mechanisms</ul>
 <ul>Attack authorization schemes</ul>
 <ul>Attack access controls</ul>
 <ul>Attack session management mechanisms</ul>
 <ul>Perform injection attacks</ul>
 <ul>Attack application logic flaws</ul>
 <ul>Attack shared environments</ul>
 <ul>Attack database connectivity</ul>
 <ul>Attack web application clients</ul>
 <ul>Attack web services</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>If hackers do not use this process and try to exploit the web application directly, their chances of failure increases. </p>
<h2>Footprint Web Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Footprinting is the process of gathering complete information about a system and all its related components, as well as how they work. Finding vulnerabilities can help attackers exploit and gain 
unauthorized access to the web application.</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>Server Discovery -> physical servers using Whois lookup, DNS interrogation, port scanning etc.</ul>
 <ul>Service Discovery -> nmap, netscantools pro etc.</ul>
 <ul>Server Identification -> banner grabbing; local identity (location, origin-host); local addresses; self-names</ul>
 <ul>Hidden Content Discovery -> extract content and functionality that is not directly linked or reachable from main visible content</ul>
 <ul>Load Balancers Detection -> detecting load balancers with real IP addresses</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Server Discovery</h2>
<p><ol>
 <ul>Whois Lookup -> whois.domaintools.com, netcraft, smartwhois (tamos.com) etc.</ul>
 <ul>DNS Interrogation -> organizations use DNS interrogation, a distributed database to connect their IP addresses with their respective hostnames and vice versa; find DNS records (network-tools.com), 
 DNSRecon, Domain Dossier (centralops.net), DNSdumpster.com</ul>
 <ul>Port scanning -> nmap, netscantools pro, advanced port scanner, hping3</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Service Discovery</h2>
<p><ol>
 <ul>80: World Wide Web standard port</ul>
 <ul>81: Alternate WWW</ul>
 <ul>88: Kerberos</ul>
 <ul>384: Remote Network Server System</ul>
 <ul>443: SSL (HTTPS)</ul>
 <ul>514: Remote Shell</ul>
 <ul>etc.</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Server Identification / Banner Grabbing</h2>
<p>Banner grabbing is a footprinting technique used by a hacker to obtain sensitive information about a target; telnet moviescope.com 80</p>
<p>Tools such as Telnet and Netcat are capable of grabbing banners of web servers over only an HTTP connection. Attackers perform the following steps to grab banners over an SSL connection:</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>Install OpenSSL</ul>
 <ul>Start OpenSSL in terminal</ul>
 <ul>s_client -host <target website> -port 443</ul>
 <ul>GET / HTTP/1.0</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Detect Web App Firewalls and Proxies on Target Site</h2>
<p>The <b>trace</b> command sends a request to the web server, asking it to send back the request. If the web server is behind a proxy the proxy modifies this request by adding extra headers. </p>

<h2>Detect Web Application Firewalls</h2>
<p>WAFs can be detected by analyzing the HTTP header request. Most firewalls edit HTTP header requests and responses vary. Tools:</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>WAFWOOF (github.com) -> identify and fingerprint WAFs protecting a website by looking at cookies, server cloaking, reponse code, drop action, pre-built-in rules</ul>
 <ul>SHIELDFY (shieldfy.io)</ul>
 <ul>nmap</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Hidden Content Discovery</h2>
<p>Hidden content and functionality not reachable from the main visible content can be discovered to exploit user privileges within the application:</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>Web Spidering / Crawling -> OWASP ZAP, Burp suite etc. </ul>
 <ul>Attacker-Directed Spidering -> OWASP ZAP</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Detect Load Balancers</h2>
<p>There are two types of load balancers: DNS load balancers (Layer 4 load balancers) and HTTP load balancers (Layer 7 load balancers). Attackers use various tools such as dig, lbd load balancing detector and 
Halberd to detect load balancers. For example, if a single host resolves to multiple IP addresses.</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>Using host command -> host <target domain></ul>
 <ul>Using dig command -> dig <target domain></ul>
 <ul>Using load balancing detector (lbd) -> lbd <target domain></ul>
</ol></p>
<p>After identifying the real IP addresses behind the load balancers, attackers perform further attacks on the target organization.</p>

<h2>Analyzing Web Applications</h2>
<p>Once attackers have attempted various possible attacks on a vulnerable web server, they may turn their attention to the web application itself. To hack the web application, first they may need to analyze it 
to determine its vulnerable areas. Even if it has only a single vulnerability, attackers try to compromise its security by launching an appropriate attack. Attackers define an <b>attack surface</b>:</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>Identify Entry Points for User Input -> gateways for attacks; attackers review generated HTTP requests to identify the user input entry points</ul>
 <ul>Identify Server-Side Technologies -> ASP, ASP.NET, ColdFusion, JSP JavaServer Pages, PHP, Python, Ruby etc.</ul>
 <ul>Identify Server-Side Functionality -> referring to ability of executing programs on output web pages</ul>
 <ul>Identify Files and Directories -> web servers host web applications, misconfigurations may lead to exposure of critical files and directories over the internet</ul>
 <ul>Identify Web Application Vulnerabilities -> web applications are developed using various technologies and platforms, not following secure coding practices in the development may leave flaws</ul>
 <ul>Map the Attack Surface</ul>
</ol></p>
<p><a target=_blank href=https://www.net-square.com>httprint</a> is a web server fingerprinting tool that relies on web server characteristics to accurately identify web servers; <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb>WhatWeb</a>
scans and identifies web technologies, including CMS, blogging platforms, JavaScript libraries etc.</p>
<p>After determining the server-side technologies, attackers try to identify the server-side functionality to find potential vulnerabilities. <a target=_blank href=https://www.gnu.org>GNU Wget</a> is employed for 
retrieving files using HTTP, HTTPS and FTP which are the most widely used internet protocols; <a target=_blank href=https://curl.se>curl</a></p>
<p>Examine URL: an SSL certified page URL starts with https; if a page contains a .aspx extension, the application is likely written using ASP.NET; if the query string has a parameter named showBy you can assume 
that the application is using a database and will display the data by that value.</p>
<p>Attackers use various techniques and tools to enumerate applications, hidden directories and files of the web application hosted on web servers; they use tools like <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/OJ/gobuster>GoBuster</a>, 
URL Fuzzer and nmap NSE script http-enum to identify files and directories of the target web application:</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>gobuster -u <target URL> -w common.txt</ul>
 <ul>gobuster -u <target UTL> -w common.txt -s 200 (files and directories with specific status codes)</ul>
 <ul>nmap -sV --script=http-enum <target domain or IP address></ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Attackers use various techniques to gain administrator-level access etc. Attackers use tools like <a target=_blank href=https://www.subgraph.com>Vega</a>, <a target=_blank href=https://wpscan.com>WPScan Vulnerability Database</a>, 
 <a target=_blank href=https://www.arachni-scanner.com>Arachni</a> and <a target=_blank href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/uniscan/>Uniscan</a> to identify vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Vega is a free and open source web security scanner and web security testing platform for testing the security of web applications. Vega helps to find and validate SQL injection, XSS, inadvertently disclosed 
sensitive information etc.</p>
<p>Once attackers detect the entry points, server-side technologies and functionalities, they map the attack surface area:</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>Client-Side Validation -> Injection Attack, Authentication Attack</ul>
 <ul>Database Interaction -> SQL Injection, Data Leakage</ul>
 <ul>File Upload and Download -> Directory Traversal</ul>
 <ul>Display of User-Supplied Data -> Cross-Site Scripting</ul>
 <ul>Dynamic Redirects -> Redirection, Header Injection</ul>
 <ul>Login -> Username enumeration, Password brute-force</ul>
 <ul>Session State -> Session Hijacking, Session Fixation</ul>
 <ul>Injection Attack -> Privilege Escalation, Access Controls</ul>
 <ul>Cleartext Communication -> Data Theft, Session Hijacking</ul>
 <ul>Error Message -> Information Leakage</ul>
 <ul>Email Interaction -> Email Injection</ul>
 <ul>Application Code -> Buffer Overflows</ul>
 <ul>Third-Party Application -> Known Vulnerabilities Exploitation</ul>
 <ul>Web Server Software -> Known Vulnerabilities Exploitation</ul>
</ol></p>
