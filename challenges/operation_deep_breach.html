<h1>Challenge: Operation Deep Breach</h1>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>TechNova Inc. is a multinational technology firm specializing in enterprise security solutions and cloud infrastructure management. 
With over 15,000 employees globally, TechNova provides cutting-edge cybersecurity consulting, digital forensics, and secure cloud hosting for high-profile clients, 
including government agencies and Fortune 500 companies. The organization's internal infrastructure is highly segmented, ensuring sensitive data remains isolated 
from public access. However, recent intelligence suggests that a misconfigured public-facing service could be the key to breaching TechNova's internal network.
Your mission is to breach TechNova Inc., leveraging publicly available services, escalating privileges, and pivoting into the internal network to reach the highest 
privileges possible.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The target machines operate on Linux, with IP addresses 192.168.1.105 and 10.10.1.136. Your first objective is to identify and exploit vulnerabilities on 
192.168.1.105 using various web exploitation techniques. After gaining initial access, escalate privileges to achieve root access. Once rooted, pivot through the 
network to reach 10.10.1.136 and escalate privileges to the highest level. This challenge tests your proficiency in web application pentesting, ExploitDB searches, 
privilege escalation, pivoting, service enumeration, and cron job exploitation</p>

<h2>Flags</h2>
<p>Challenge 1:</p>
<p>Identify the number of user accounts pertaining to the web application. (Answer Format: N)</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p><ol>
<ul>In order to keep results administered, I use Metasploit for the investigation. Because when using nmap all results are volatile.</ul>
<ul>sudo su</ul>
<ul>systemctl start postgresql</ul>
<ul>msfdb init</ul>
<ul>msfconsole</ul>
<ul>workspace -a deep_breach</ul>
<ul>db_nmap -Sv 192.168.1.105/24</ul>
<ul>db_nmap -A 192.168.1.105/24</ul>
<ul>as we can see, port 80 is open</ul>
<ul>db_nmap --script http-enum 192.168.1.105</ul>
<ul>result shows that php is available (login.php) and there is an upload folder (/uploads/)</ul>
<ul>let's do some Nikto kungfu</ul>
<ul>nikto -h 192.168.1.105</ul>
<ul>Apache 2.4.18 appears to be outdated</ul>
<ul>/db.php might be interesting</ul>
<ul>cd /home/kali/Downloads</ul>
<ul>wget http://192.168.1.105/db.php</ul>
<ul>db.php seems to be an empty file</ul>
<ul>It's time to visit the web page</ul>
<ul>Browser: http://192.168.1.105</ul>
<ul>The web application is a ticketing system and we can access the /uploads folder easily</ul>
<ul>Now, we see if SQL Injection is possible</ul>
<ul>SQLmap and BurpSuite are available</ul>
<ul>Use BurpSuite and SQLmap to detect any SQL Injection vulnerabilities</ul>
<ul>I could not find any method for SQL injection using SQLmap</ul>
<ul>I installed OWASP ZAP and ran a scan on 192.168.1.105</ul>
<ul>ZAP tells me SQL Injection is possible</ul>
</ol></p>
