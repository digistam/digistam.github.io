You are the head of the Network Administrators department. And one of your subordinates uses SNMP to manage networked devices from a remote location. 
And one of your subordinates uses SNMP to manage networked devices from a remote location. To manage network nodes, your subordinate uses MIB, which 
contains formal descriptions of all network objects managed by SNMP. He accesses the contents of MIB by using a web browser either by entering the IP 
address and Lseries.mib or by entering the DNS library name and Lseries.mib. You know that your subordinate can retrieve information from a MIB that 
contains object types for workstations and server services. Which of the following types of MIB will your subordinate use to retrieve information about 
types for workstations and server services?
answer: LNMIB2.MIB

Ivan, the evil hacker, decided to attack the cloud services of the target organization. First of all, he decided to infiltrate the target's MSP 
provider by sending phishing emails that distributed specially created malware. This program compromised users' credentials, and Ivan managed to 
gain remote access to the cloud service. Further, he accessed the target customer profiles with his MSP account, compressed the customer data, 
and stored them in the MSP. After this, he used this information to launch further attacks on the target organization. Which of the following cloud 
attacks did Ivan perform? 
answer: Cloudborne attack

You must discover all the active devices hidden by a restrictive firewall in the IPv4 range in a target network. Which of the following host discovery 
techniques will you use?
answer: ARP ping scan

Identify the attack by description: The attacker decides to attack IoT devices. First, he will record the frequency required to share information between 
connected devices. Once he gets the necessary frequency, the attacker will capture the original data when the connected devices initiate commands. 
As soon as he collects original data, he will use tools such as URH to segregate the command sequence. The final step in this attack will be starting 
injecting the segregated command sequence on the same frequency into the IoT network, which repeats the captured signals of the devices.
answer: Replay attack

Identify the phase of the APT lifecycle that the hacker is in at the moment according to the scenario given below: The hacker prepared for an attack and 
attempted to enter the target network using techniques such as sending spear-phishing emails and exploiting vulnerabilities on publicly available servers. 
Thanks to the successful attack, he deployed malware on the target system to establish an outbound connection and began to move on.
answer: Initial intrusion

answer: Bluesnarfing

Viktor, a professional hacker, targeted an organizationâ€™s network to sniff all the traffic. During this process, Viktor plugged in a rogue switch 
to an unused port in the LAN with a priority lower than any other switch in the network so that he could make it a root bridge that will later allow 
him to sniff all the traffic in the network. What is the attack performed by Viktor in the above scenario?
answer: DNS poisoning attack
