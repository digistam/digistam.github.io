<h1>Cloud Hacking</h1>
<h2>Container vulnerability scanning using Trivy</h2>  
<p>Container images consist of an operating system, application, runtime etc. packaged together. <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy>Trivy</a> is an automated tool used to 
  perform container image vulnerability scanning. </p>
  <h2>Kubernetes vulnerability scanning using Sysdig</h2>
  <p>Kubernetes is a complex environment that often suffers cluster misconfigurations. <a target=_blank href=https://sysdig.com>Sysdig</a> identifies Kubernetes vulnerabilities.</p>
  <h2>Enumerating S3 Buckets</h2>
<p>Attackers can exploit misconfigurations in bucket implementation and breach the security mechanism to compromise data privacy.</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Inspecting HTML -> find URLs to target S3 buckets</ul>
    <ul>Brute-forcing URL -> each S3 bucket has a unique identification number, attackers perform brute-force attacks on the target bucket to identify the correct bucket URL; Burp suite</ul>
    <ul>Finding subdomains -> tools such as OWASP Amass and Robtex</ul>
    <ul>Reverse IP search -> advanced search operator ip:[TARGET IP ADDRESS] in Bing search engine</ul>
    <ul>Advanced Google Hacking -> inurl: s3.amazonaws.com</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Identifying Open S3 Buckets using S3Scanner</h2>
  <p>Attackers use <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/sa7mon/S3Scanner>S3Scanner</a> to identify open S3 buckets of cloud services and retrieve their content for malicious purposes.</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>s3scanner --threads 8 scan --buckets-file ./bucket-names.txt</ul>
    <ul>s3scanner dump --bucket my-bucket-to-dump</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Enumerating AWS Account IDs</h2>
  <p>AWS accounts are identified via unique IDs, which, when exposed in the public domain, can be leveraged by attackers to target cloud services. These unique IDs are meant to be private but 
  are often exposed to the public without the user's knowledge. Attackers enumerate AWS account IDs via:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>AWS error messages</ul>
    <ul>Code repositories, such as Github</ul>
    <ul>Screenshots</ul>
    <ul>Databases</ul>
    <ul>Public elastic block store snapshots</ul>
    <ul>People posting personal IDs to seek online assistance/troubleshooting</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <p>After obtaining account IDs, attackers can perform various activities such as resource enumeration (discovering existing roles, users etc.), IAM role assumption, invocation of Lambda functions</p>
<h2>Enumerating IAM Roles</h2>
  <p>Attackers enumerate IAM role names by analyzing the AWS error messages, which reveal information regarding the existence of a user. Generally, in AWS cloud services, users are allowed to perform 
  numerous attempts to assume a role. For every failed attempt, AWS response messages reveal information about the existence of the role. If the AWS blocks an account after some failed attempts, implementing 
  a brute-force technique can be difficult but not impossible. By executing the process with a fragmented set of accounts or nodes, attackers can ultimately evade IP and account filtering solutions.</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Internal software / stacks</ul>
    <ul>IAM user names (used for social engineering)</ul>
    <ul>AWS services in use</ul>
    <ul>3rd-party software in use </ul>
  </ol></p>
  <p>After enumerating the roles, attackers can try to assume an open role and steal its credentials. For example, if an attacker tries to assume a role that is not permitted, the AWS produces an error message. 
  By analyzing the error message, attackers can confirm the existence of the role but cannot assume it. By using any valid account ID and well-filtered wordlist, attackers can enumerate existing IAM roles.</p>

  <h2>Enumerating Bucket Permissions using S3Inspector</h2>
  <p>Attackers use <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/vpistis/s3-inspector>S3Inspector</a> to enumerate AWS S3 bucket permissions. By using this tool, attackers can verify whether a bucket is public or 
  non-public. In case of a public bucket, attackers can acquire the bucket permissions and a list of URLs to access it. Non-public buckets respond with access denied.</p>

  <h2>Enumerating Kubernetes etcd</h2>
  <p>Kubernetes is a distributed computing platform; therefore, it requires a distributed database, such as etcd. Gaining access to etcd is the same as obtaining root-level access to the system. In 
  Kubernetes, only the API server is allowed to access the etcd store. Attackers enumerate etcd processes, configuration files, open ports (identifying port 2379) etc. to identify endpoints connected 
  to the Kubernetes environment.</p>
  <h2>Enumerating Azure Active Directory (AD) Accounts</h2>
  <p>Cloud platforms such as Office 365 can be accessed directly from the internet. Hence, attackers target these environments to initiate different attacks 
  on Azure Active Directory (AD) and Office 365.</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul><b>Account enumeration</b> -> Azure AD users having access to the services of Office 365 can enumerate all the user accounts as well as admin groups - this 
      attracts attackers; The <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/nccgroup/azucar>Azucar</a> tool allows users to assess the overall security of an Azure
    environment</ul>
    <ul><b>Password spraying</b> -> attackers use password spraying to perform automated password guessing on Azure AD accounts; This method does NOT lead to 
    account lockouts; The <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/sensepost/ruler>Ruler</a> tool allows attackers to communicate with exchange servers</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Gathering Cloud Keys Through IMDS Attack</h2>
  <p>In an AWS environment, <b>cloud access keys</b> are the security credentials used by an 
    <a target=_blank href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html>IAM user</a> or AWS account root user to access AWS services. 
  An <b>access key</b> and a <b>secret access key</b> are integral parts of cloud keys, which can be used to authenticate requests. Attackers launch 
    <a target=_blank href=https://www.sans.org/blog/cloud-instance-metadata-services-imds-/>IMDS attacks</a>  
  to obtain these cloud keys to gain access to cloud resources. The attacker can access a REST API operating at a particular IP address through IMDS.</p>

  <h2>Exploiting Amazon Cloud Infrastructure using Nimbostratus</h2>
  <p><a target=_blank href=https://andresriancho.github.io>Nimbostratus</a> is a tool used for fingerprinting and exploiting Amazon cloud infrastructures. 
  It allows attackers to enumerate access to AWS services for the current IAM role; use a poorly configured IAM role to create new AWS user; extract current 
  AWS credentials from metadata, .boto.cfg files, environment variables etc.; clone DBs to access information stored in snapshot etc.</p>
  <p>Always use <a target=_blank href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html>IAM</a> instead of allowing direct root access.</p>

  <h2>Exploiting Misconfigured AWS S3 Buckets</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Step 1: Identify S3 buckets -> S3Scanner, lazys3, Bucket Finder, s3-buckets-bruteforcer; gather URLs of the identified buckets</ul>
    <ul>Step 2: Setup AWS command line interface (aws-cli)</ul>
    <ul>Step 3: Extract access keys -> create account, add user, download CSV file and extract access keys</ul>
    <ul>Step 4: Configure aws-cli</ul>
    <ul>Step 5: Identify vulnerable S3 buckets -> <i>aws s3 ls s3://[bucket-name] --no-sign-request</i></ul>
    <ul>Step 6: Exploit S3 buckets</ul>
  </ol></p>

<h2>Compromising AWS IAM Credentials</h2>
  <p>AWS IAM helps IT administrators manage the AWS user identities and levels of access to AWS resources. Various security vulnerabilities exploited 
  by attackers:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Repository Misconfigurations -> most organizations host their AWS keys in a shared storage on an internal network, such as a Git repo so 
    developers can access and use them when needed; disgruntled insiders may misuse the keys and keys can unknowingly be shared to a shared repo</ul>
    <ul>Social Engineering -> fake emails, calls, SMS etc.</ul>
    <ul>Password reuse</ul>
    <ul>Server Side Request Forgery</ul>
    <ul>Reading local file</ul>
    <ul>Exploiting third party software</ul>
    <ul>Insider threat</ul>
  </ol></p>

  <h2>Hijacking Misconfigured IAM Roles using Pacu</h2>
  <p>Pacu is an open-source AWS exploitation framework for enumerating and hijacking IAM roles. Pacu contains a 1100+ wordlist of commonly used role 
  names and automatically alerts the attacker when the role is identified</p>

<h2>Cracking AWS access keys using DumpsterDiver</h2>
<p><a target=_blank href=https://github.com/securing/DumpsterDiver>DumpsterDiver</a> allows attackers to examine a large volume of file types while 
scanning hardcoded secret keys, such as AWS access, SSL and Microsoft Azure keys. Attackers use DumpsterDiver to identify potential secret leaks and 
hardcoded passwords in the target cloud services.</p>

  <h2>Exploiting Docker containers on AWS using Cloud Container Attack Tool (CCAT)</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Step 1: Abuse AWS credentials -> CCAT provides Enumerate ECR module to list the details of available ECR repos</ul>
    <ul>Step 2: Pull the target Docker image</ul>
    <ul>Step 3: Create a backdoor image</ul>
    <ul>Step 4: Push the backdoor Docker image</ul>
  </ol></p>

  <h2>Serverless-Based attacks on AWS Lambda</h2>
  <p>As serverless functions can run without a managed server, they are vulnerable to different application-level attacks such as DDoS, command injection 
  and cross-site scripting XSS. Attackers can abuse AWS Lambda functions to gain privileges and compromise the confidentiality of an account.</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Black Box Scenario -> attackers make assumptions regarding specific feature as they do not have prior information about the internal working systems or 
    the environment</ul>
    <ul>White Box Scenario -> attackers hold prior information about the environment which helps them in achieving their goals</ul>
  </ol></p>

  <h2>Exploiting Shadow Admins in AWS</h2>
  <p>Shadow admins are user accounts with specific permissions that allow attackers to penetrate the target cloud network. Attackers can exploit shadow 
  admins only after gaining some kind of access to the target environment. Attackers abuse show admin permissions to escalate privileges and gain control 
  over the target cloud environment -> <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/cyberark/SkyArk>SkyArk</a>, Red-Shadow, ACLight2</p>

<h2>Exploiting Docker Remote API</h2>
  <p>After gaining access to the target Docker host, attackers exploit the Docker remote API to launch further attacks, such as mining cryptocurrency, 
  initiating attacks by masking IPs, creating botnets to perform DoS attacks, installing services for phishing campaigns, compromising the security of 
  the internal network etc. Attackers create a new container and mount it to the folder on the Docker host to gain access to other files.</p>

  <h2>Hacking Container Volumes</h2>
  <p>In Kubernetes, containers use volumes to share filesystems and manipulate container files. A volume is similar to a directory that stores files 
  and is accessible to all containers in a pod. Kubernetes supports different types of volumes, such as NFS and Internet small computer systems interface 
  (iSCSI), using various protocols. Weak and default configs in these volumes may be exploited by attackers to launch privilege escalation attacks and 
  perform a lateral movement in the internal network.</p>

  <h2>CloudGoat 2 - vulnerable by design AWS deployment tool</h2>
  <p><a target=_blank href=https://rhinosecuritylabs.com>CloudGoat 2</a> allows you to hone your cloud cybersecurity skills by creating and completing 
  several "capture-the-flag" style scenarios.</p>

<h2>Gaining access by exploiting SSRF vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>Attackers can exploit <a target=_blank href=https://www.f5.com/glossary/ssrf#:~:text=SSRF%20is%20a%20type%20of,compromise%2C%20and%20remote%20code%20execution.>SSRF vulnerabilities</a>
in a web application that is hosting the cloud service to retrieve the AWS credentials for a role (Server Side Request Forgery)</p>  

  <h2>AWS IAM Privilege Escalation Techniques</h2>
  <p>After gaining access to the target cloud services, attackers attempt to exploit their privileges to expand their attack surfaces and perform further 
  exploitation.</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Create a new policy version</ul>
    <ul>Assign the default policy version to an existing version</ul>
    <ul>Create an EC2 instance with an existing instance profile</ul>
    <ul>Create a new user access key</ul>
    <ul>Create / update login profile</ul>
    <ul>Attach a policy to a user /group/role</ul>
    <ul>Create / update an inline policy for user/group/role</ul>
    <ul>Add a user to a group</ul>
  </ol></p>

<h2>Escalating privileges of Google Storage Buckets using GCPBucketBrute</h2>
<p>Similar to Amazon AWS S3 buckets, Google Storage uses buckets for static file storage. Vulnerabilities in bucket permission policies may expose
the buckets to all GCP users or even to the public internet. Like AWS S3 buckets, Google Storage buckets are also vulnerable to privilege escalation 
attacks through misconfigured bucket ACLs. <a target=_blank href=https://rhinosecuritylabs.com>DCPBucketBrute</a> is a script-based tool that allows 
attackers to enumerate Google storage buckets; Using this tool, attackers can check the bucket's policy by making a direct HTTP request to 
<i>https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/BUCKETNAME/iam</i>. If allusers or allAuthenticatedUsers can read the bucket policy, attackers get a valid 
response; otherwise, an access denied message is displayed.</p>
