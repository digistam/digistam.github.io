<h1>Differences XSS, CSRF, CSLF etc.</h1>
  <h2>XSS</h2>
<p>XSS stands for Cross-site scripting. It's like someone sneaking a message into a conversation. XSS, or Cross-site scripting, is a sneaky way attackers can insert harmful codes into web applications. When this happens, 
  the target is often the application itself. Remember: the user DOESN't have to be logged in (an active session is not needed).</p>
<h2>CSRF</h2>
  <p>Remember: the user HAS to be <b>logged in</b> (there has to be an active session). The term "logged in" is most important. CSRF is also named XSRF. The purpose is to send malicious requests with the user's browser. 
    Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of online attack that tricks an unsuspecting user into performing an unwanted action on a website where they are authenticated. The main target of CSRF is the 
    authenticated user, and the attacker's aim is to perform an action on behalf of that user without their knowledge or consent. Example: Imagine you're logged into your account on example.com.
    While still logged in, you decide to visit another website, let's call it malicious.com. Unknown to you, this site contains a hidden script. As you browse malicious.com, this script covertly attempts to send a 
    request to example.com, trying to change your email address on your behalf. Since you are already authenticated on example.com, the website might consider this request legitimate, leading to potential misuse of 
    your account.</p>

<h2>SSRF</h2>
  <p>Server-side request forgery is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to cause the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location. In a typical SSRF attack, the attacker might cause 
    the server to make a connection to internal-only services within the organization's infrastructure. In other cases, they may be able to force the server to connect to arbitrary external systems. This could leak 
    sensitive data, such as authorization credentials. SSRF stands for Server-Side Request Forgery, and although both describe forged requests, it is very different from CSRF. CSRF is all about compromising the browser 
    and the user, while SSRF is about compromising the server and the environment itself.</p>
  <p>Attackers exploit server-side request forgery vulnerabilities in public web servers to send crafted requests to internal or backend servers. Internal servers usually employ firewalls to prevent unwanted traffic 
  inflows to the network. Therefore, attackers leverage SSRF vulnerabilities in internet-facing web servers to gain access to backend servers that are protected by a firewall, VPN or access control lists (ACL). The
  backend server believes that the request is made by the web server because these servers are on the same network; consequently, the backend server responds with the data in it. Once the attack is succesful, attackers 
  can perform various actions such as port scanning, network scanning, IP address discovery, reading of web server files, bypassing of host-based authentication, interaction with critical protocols, and remote code 
  execution.</p>

  <h2>XSPA</h2>
  <p>Cross Site Port Attack is an abbreviation of XSPA. In this attack an application processes user supplied URLs and does not verify or sanitize the back end response received from remote servers before sending it 
    back to the client. An attacker can send crafted queries to a vulnerable web application to proxy attacks to external Internet facing servers, intranet devices and the web server itself. The responses, in certain 
    cases, can be studied to identify service availability like open ports, banner versions etc. and even fetch data from remote services in an unconventional ways. It allows attackers to abuse available functionality 
    in most web applications to scan port of intranet and external Internet facing servers, fingerprint internal (non-Internet exposed) network aware services, perform banner grabbing, identify web application frameworks, 
    exploit vulnerable programs, run code on reachable machines, exploit web application vulnerabilities listening on internal networks, read local files using the file protocol and much more.</p>
    <p>Most XSPA attack occurs when <b>xmlrpc.php</b> file is enabled. I exploited the file and got an IP address and when I visited that IP address there wasn’t any content on it but when I used directory traversal 
      payload I was able to call /etc/passwd file.</p>

  <h2>CRLF</h2>
  <p>CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) vulnerability is a type of security flaw that can occur in web applications. It allows an attacker to inject newline characters into the HTTP headers, which can be used to perform 
    various types of attacks, such as HTTP response splitting and cache poisoning. CRLF refers to the combination of two special characters, the Carriage Return (CR) and the Line Feed (LF), that are used to mark the 
    end of a line in text files. In web applications, these characters are used to separate different parts of an HTTP request or response, such as the headers, the body, and the status line. CRLF vulnerability occurs 
    when an attacker is able to insert these characters into unexpected places in the headers, which can cause the web application to behave in unexpected ways. To find CRLF vulnerabilities, you can use various tools 
    such as web application scanners, penetration testing tools, and manual testing methods. Web application scanners can automatically scan your web application for CRLF vulnerabilities, while penetration testing tools 
    can be used to manually test for the presence of these vulnerabilities. Manual testing methods include sending HTTP requests with special characters in the headers and observing the web application’s response.</p>
  <p>CRLF vulnerabilities can have a variety of impacts on web applications, depending on the specific vulnerability and the context in which it is found. Some of the most common impacts include:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>HTTP response splitting: An attacker can use CRLF characters to split an HTTP response into multiple parts, which can be used to inject malicious content into the web page or to redirect users to a malicious website.</ul>
    <ul>Cache poisoning: An attacker can use CRLF characters to change the caching behavior of the web application, which can cause the web application to return malicious content to users instead of the intended content.</ul>
    <ul>Cross-site scripting (XSS): An attacker can use CRLF characters to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, which can be used to steal sensitive information from users or to perform other types of attacks.</ul>
  </ol></p>
