<h1>Public Key Infrastructure</h1>
<p>PKI is a security architecture developed to increase the confidentiality of information exchanged over the insecure Internet. 
  It includes hardware, software, people, policies, and procedures required to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates. 
  In cryptography, the PKI helps to bind public keys with corresponding user identities by means of a certification authority (CA).</p>
  <h2>PKI components</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Certificate Management System -> generates, distributes, stores and verifies certificates</ul>
  <ul>Digital certificates -> establishes credentials of a person when performing online transactions</ul>
  <ul>Validation Authority (VA) -> stores certificates (incl. their public keys)</ul>
  <ul>Certification Authority (CA) -> issues and verifies digital certificates</ul>
  <ul>End user -> requests, manages and uses certificates</ul>
  <ul>Registration Authority (RA) -> acts as the verifier for the CA</ul>
</ol></p>

  <p>PKI is a comprehensive system that allows the use of public-key encryption and digital signature services across a wide variety of applications. 
    PKI authentication depends on digital certificates (also known as public-key certificates) that CAs sign and provide. A digital certificate is a 
    digitally signed statement with a public key and the subject (user, company, or system) name in it. PKI uses public-key cryptography, 
    which is widely used on the Internet to encrypt messages or authenticate message senders. In public-key cryptography, a CA generates public 
    and private keys with the same algorithm simultaneously. The private key is held only by the subject (user, company, or system) mentioned in the 
    certificate, while the public key is made publicly available in a directory that all parties can access. The subject keeps the private key secret and 
    uses it to decrypt the text encrypted by someone else using the corresponding public key (available in a public directory). Thus, others encrypt messages for 
    the user with the userâ€™s public key, and the user decrypts it with his/her private key</p>
