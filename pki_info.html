<h1>Public Key Infrastructure</h1>
<p>PKI is a security architecture developed to increase the confidentiality of information exchanged over the insecure Internet. 
  It includes hardware, software, people, policies, and procedures required to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates. 
  In cryptography, the PKI helps to bind public keys with corresponding user identities by means of a certification authority (CA).</p>
  <h2>PKI components</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Certificate Management System -> generates, distributes, stores and verifies certificates</ul>
  <ul>Digital certificates -> establishes credentials of a person when performing online transactions</ul>
  <ul>Validation Authority (VA) -> stores certificates (incl. their public keys)</ul>
  <ul>Certification Authority (CA) -> issues and verifies digital certificates</ul>
  <ul>End user -> requests, manages and uses certificates</ul>
  <ul>Registration Authority (RA) -> acts as the verifier for the CA</ul>
</ol></p>

  <p>PKI is a comprehensive system that allows the use of public-key encryption and digital signature services across a wide variety of applications. 
    PKI authentication depends on digital certificates (also known as public-key certificates) that CAs sign and provide. A digital certificate is a 
    digitally signed statement with a public key and the subject (user, company, or system) name in it. PKI uses public-key cryptography, 
    which is widely used on the Internet to encrypt messages or authenticate message senders. In public-key cryptography, a CA generates public 
    and private keys with the same algorithm simultaneously. The private key is held only by the subject (user, company, or system) mentioned in the 
    certificate, while the public key is made publicly available in a directory that all parties can access. The subject keeps the private key secret and 
    uses it to decrypt the text encrypted by someone else using the corresponding public key (available in a public directory). Thus, others encrypt messages for 
    the user with the userâ€™s public key, and the user decrypts it with his/her private key</p>

  <h2>Steps involved in PKI process</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>The subject (user, company, system) intending to exchange information securely applies for a certificate to the registration authority (RA)</ul>
    <ul>The RA receives the request from the subject, verifies the subject's identity and requests the CA to issue a public key certificate to the user</ul>
    <ul>The CA issues the public key certificate binding the subject's identity with the subject's public key; then the updated information is sent to the validation authority (VA)</ul>
    <ul>When a user makes a transaction, the user duly signs the message digitally using the public key certificate and sends the message to the client</ul>
    <ul>The client verifies the authenticity of the user by inquiring with the VA about the validity of the user's public key certificate</ul>
    <ul>The VA compares the public key certificate of the user with that of the updated information provided by the CA and determines the result (valid or invalid)</ul>
  </ol></p>

  <h2>Certification Authorities</h2>
<p>CAs are trusted entities that issue digital certificates. The digital certificate certifies the posession of the 
public key by the subject (user, company or system) specified in the certificate. This aids others to trust signatures or 
statements made by the private key that is associated with the certified public key.</p>

<h2>Signed Certificates (CA) vs. Self-Signed Certificate</h2>
<p>Signed Certificate: the user gets a digital certificate from a trustworthy CA. The digital 
certificate contains name of the certificate holder, a serial number, expiration dates, a copy of 
the certificate holder's public key and the digital signature of the receiver. The receiver can 
verify the certificate by enquiring with validation authority (VA). VA verifies the validity of 
the certificate.</p>
<p>Self-Signed Certificate: the user creates self-signed certificate using a certification creation tool, 
such as Adobe Acrobat Reader, Java's keytool or Apple's Keychain. The certificate contains name of the user, 
user's public key and his digital signature. The user signs the document using self-signed certificate and 
sends it to the receiver. The receiver can verify the certificate by enquiring with the user. The user verifies 
the certificate to the receiver.</p>
