<h1>Blind SQL Injection Vulnerability in MySQL and MSSQL</h1>
<p>An attacker can identify blind SQL injection vulnerabilities by simply testing the <b>URLS</b> of a target website.</p>
<p>For example: <i>shop.com/items.php?id=101</i> has corresponding SQL query <i>SELECT * FROM ITEMS WHERE ID = 101</i> </p>
