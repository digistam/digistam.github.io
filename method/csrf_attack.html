<h2>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attack</h2>
<p>Also known as one-click attack, occurs when a hacker instructs a user's web browser to send a request to the vulnerable website through a malicious web page. Finance-related websites commonly contain 
CSRF vulnerabilities. Usually, outside attackers cannot access corporate intranets; hence CSRF is one of the methods used to enter these networks. The inability of web applications to differentiate 
a request made using malicious code from a genuine request exposes it to a CSRF attack. Such attacks exploit web page vulnerabilities that allow attackers to force unsuspecting users' browsers to send 
malicious requests that they did not intend to send. The victim holds an active session with a trusted site and simultaneously visits a malicious site, which injects an HTTP request for the trusted site 
into the victim user's session, compromising its integrity.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the attacker constructs a malicious script and stores it on a malicious web server. When a user visits the website, the malicous script starts running and the attacker gains access 
to the user's browser.</p>
