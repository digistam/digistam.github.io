<h1>Automated pentest with Owasp Zap</h1>
<p>OWASP Zap is a security testing framework much like Burp Suite. It acts as a very robust enumeration tool. It’s used to test web applications. </p>
  
<h2>What we can do</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Automated Scan</ul>
    <ul>Directory Bruteforce</ul>
    <ul>Authenticated Scan</ul>
    <ul>Login Page Bruteforce</ul>
    <ul>Install ZAP Extensions</ul>
</ol></p>

<p>ZAP can be used as your go-to tool to start Web Application testing but it should not be your only tool. ZAP is just one of many tools to put under your hacker utility belt.</p>

    <h2>Automated scan</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>sudo apt install zaproxy</ul>
        <ul>sudo owasp-zap</ul>
        <ul>Click <b>Automated Scan</b> button in the right pane</ul>
        <ul>Input target url</ul>
        <ul>The automated scan performs both passive and automated scans to build a sitemap and detect vulnerabilities</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>On the next page you may see the options to select either to use “traditional spider” or “Ajax spider”.
        A traditional spider scan is a passive scan that enumerates links and directories of the website. It builds a website index without 
        brute-forcing. This is much quieter than a brute-force attack and can still net a login page or other juicy details, 
        but is not as comprehensive as a bruteforce. The Ajax Spider is an add-on that integrates in ZAP a crawler of AJAX rich sites called 
        Crawljax. You can use it in conjunction with the traditional spider for better results. It uses your web browser and proxy. 
        The easiest way to use the Ajax Spider is with HTMLUnit. To install HTML Unit use the command:</p>
    <p><i>sudo apt install libjenkins-htmlunit-core-js-java</i></p>
    <p>And then select HtmlUnity from the Ajax Spider Dropdown</p>
    <p>With very minimal setup we were able to do an automated scan that gave us a sitemap and a handful of vulnerabilities.</p>

    <h2>Manual scanning</h2>
    <p>First, set-up a proxy between Owasp Zap and your browser</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Tools > Options > Network > Local servers / Proxies</ul>
        <ul>Address: IP address of the machine</ul>
        <ul>Port: 8080</ul>
        <ul>Tools > Options > Network > Server Certificates</ul>
        <ul>Root CA certificate must be available</ul>
        <ul>Click Save and store zap_root_ca.cer somewhere</ul>
        <ul>Then, open Firefox, navigate to your preferences, and search for certificates and click “View Certificates”</ul>
        <ul>Then click “Import” and then navigate to the earlier downloaded certificate and open it</ul>
        <ul>Select both 'Trust' checkboxes and click OK</ul>
        <ul>Go back to your Firefox preferences and search for “proxy”. Click Settings.</ul>
        <ul>Manual proxy configuration</ul>
        <ul>IP: 127.0.0.1</ul>
        <ul>Port: 8080</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>Without your Zap application being authenticated, it can’t scan pages that are only accessible when you’ve logged in. 
        Lets set up the OWASP ZAP application to scan these pages, using your logged in session.</p> 

    <h2>Install Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>cd /var/www/html</ul>
        <ul>sudo git clone https://github.com/digininja/DVWA.git</ul>
        <ul>sudo mv DVWA dvwa</ul>
        <ul>chmod -R 777 dvwa</ul>
        <ul>cd dvwa/config</ul>
        <ul>ls</ul>
        <ul>we can see the config.inc.php.dist file</ul>
        <ul>sudo cp config.inc.php.dist config.inc.php</ul>
        <ul>sudo nano config.inc.php</ul>
        <ul>change user to 'user' and password to 'pass'</ul>
        <ul>Save it</ul>
        <ul>service mysql restart</ul>
        <ul>sudo mysql -u root -p</ul>
        <ul>enter password: root</ul>
        <ul>create user 'user'@'127.0.0.1' identified by 'pass';</ul>
        <ul>grant all privileges on dvwa.* to 'user'@'127.0.0.1' identified by 'pass';</ul>
        <ul>exit</ul>
        <ul>cd /etc/php; ls</ul>
        <ul>cd [PHP version]/apache2</ul>
        <ul>sudo nano php.ini</ul>
        <ul>change the allow_url_fopen and allow_url_include values</ul>
        <ul>allow_url_fopen = On</ul>
        <ul>allow_url_include = On</ul>
        <ul>Save and exit</ul>
        <ul>service apache2 start</ul>
        <ul>Open http://localhost/dvwa in the browser</ul>
        <ul>login with user and pass</ul>
        <ul>click on “Create/Reset Database”</ul>
        <ul>Log in with 'admin' and 'password'</ul>
    </ol>
<p>Once you’ve logged in, navigate to the DVWA Security tab and set the Security level to Low and then hit submit</p>

    <h2>Get Authentication token</h2>
    <p>We’re going to pass our authentication token into ZAP so that we can use the tool to scan authenticated webpages</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>In the logging in DVWA browser tab open Developers tools</ul>
        <ul>Enter inspect element and take note of your PHPSESSION cookie</ul>
        <ul>Copy cookie value</ul>
        <ul>In Owasp Zap click the + symbol (New Tab button) in the lower pane and select <b>HTTP Sessions</b></ul>
        <ul>Set the authenticated session as active</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>Now re-scan the application. You’ll see it’s able to pick up a lot more. 
        This is because its able to see all of the sections of DVWA that was previously behind the login page.</p>
