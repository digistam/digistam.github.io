<h1>Patches and Updates</h1>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Scan for existing vulnerabilities; patch and update the server software regularly</ul>
  <ul>Before applying any service pack, hotfix or security patch read and peer review all relevant documentation</ul>
  <ul>Apply all updates, regardless of their type on an 'as-needed' basis</ul>
  <ul>Test service packs and hotfixes on a representative non-production environment prior to their deployment in production</ul>
  <ul>Ensure that service packs, hotfixes and security patch levels are consistent on all domain controllers (DCs)</ul>
  <ul>Ensure that server outages are scheduled and that a complete set of backup tapes and emergency repair disks are available</ul>
  <ul>Keep a backup plan that allows the system and enterprise to return to their original state, prior to a failed implementation</ul>
  <ul>Schedule periodic service-pack upgrades as part of operations maintenance and never trail by more than two service packs</ul>
  <ul>Disable all unused script extension mappings</ul>
  <ul>Avoid using default configurations dispatched with web servers</ul>
  <ul>Use virtual patches in the organization because they provide additional identification / logging capabilities</ul>
  <ul>Establish a disaster recovery plan to handle patch management failures</ul>
  <ul>Conduct an extensive risk assessment to determine which segments of the network are most vulnerable or at high risk that need to be patched first</ul>
  <ul>Make a detailed inventory of all the endpoints, services, and dependencies</ul>
  <ul>While deploying a patch to the full system, ensure that it is performed in testing environment first</ul>
  <ul>Deploy an alerting system for patches</ul>
  <ul>Use a patch management application or system such as SolarWinds Patch Manager to automate the procedure</ul>
  <ul>Regularly conduct monitoring and reporting to ensure your patch management processes and updates are performing effectively</ul>
  <ul>Reduce your exposure to third-party risks by limiting the number of software versions you employ</ul>
  <ul>All patch and update operations should be validated and documented for accessibility, analysis, and confirmation</ul>
  <ul>Make a standardized patch management and security update methodology as part of the SDLC</ul>
</ol></p>
  <p>Developers always attempt to find bugs in a web server and fix them. Bug fixes are distributed in the form of patches, which provide protection against known vulnerabilities. 
  Unpatched of vulnerable patches can create a security loophole in the web server. </p>
  <h2>Patches and Hotfixes</h2>
  <p>A patch is a small piece of software designed to fix problems, security vulnerabilities and bugs as well as improve the usability or performance of a computer program or its supporting data. 
  A patch can be considered a repair job for a programming problem. A software vulnerability is the weakness of a software program that makes it susceptible to malware attacks. Software vendors 
  provide patches that prevent exploitations and reduce the probability of threats exploiting a specific vulnerability. Patches include fixes and updates for multiple known bugs or issues. 
  A patch is publicly released update that is available for all customers. A system without patches is much more vulnerable to attacks than a regularly patched system. If an attacker can identify 
  a vulnerability before it is fixed, then the system might be susceptible to malware attacks.</p>
  <p>A hotfix is a package used to address a critical defect in a live environment and contains a fix for a single issue. It updates a specific product version. Hotfixes provide quick solutions and 
  ensure that the issues are resolved. Apply hotfixes to software patches on production systems. Vendors update users about the latest hotfixes through email of make them available on their official 
  website. Hotfixes are updates that fix a specific customer issue and are not always distributed outside the customer organization. Vendors occasionally deliver hotfixes as a set of fixes called 
  a combined hotfix or service pack.</p>
  <h2>What is Patch Management</h2>
  <p>Patch management is an area of systems management that involves acquiring, testing and installing multiple patches (code changes) in an administered computer system. Patch management is a 
  method of defense agains vulnerabilities that cause security weaknesses or corrupt data. It is a process of scanning for network vulnerabilities, detecting missed security patches and hotfixes 
  and then deploying the relevant patches as soon as they are available to secure the network. It involves:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Choosing, verifying, testing and applying patches</ul>
    <ul>Updating previously applied patches with current patches</ul>
    <ul>Listing patches applied previously to the current software</ul>
    <ul>Recording repositories or depots of patches for easy selection</ul>
    <ul>Assigning and deploying the applied patches</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <p>An automated patch management process includes the following steps:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Detect -> use tools to detect missing security patches</ul>
    <ul>Assess -> assess the issues and its associated severity by mitigating the factors that may influence the decision</ul>
    <ul>Acquire -> download the patch for testing</ul>
    <ul>Test -> install the patch first on a test machine to verify the consequence of the update</ul>
    <ul>Deploy -> deploy the patch to computers and ensure that applications are not affected</ul>
    <ul>Maintain -> subscribe to receive notifications about vulnerabilities when they are reported</ul>
  </ol></p>

    <h2>Installation of a Patch</h2>
    <p>The installation of a patch entails the following tasks:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Identifying Appropriate Sources for Updates and Patches -> create a patch management plan that fits the operational environment and business objectives; find appropriate updates and patches on the 
        home sites of the applications or OS vendors; the recommended method of tracking issues relevant to proactive patching is to register to the home sites to receive alerts</ul>
        <ul>Installation of a Patch -> users can access and install security patches via the WWW in two ways: manual installation and automatic installation (auto update)</ul>
        <ul>Implementation and verification of a Security Patch or Upgrade -> before installing any patch, verify the source; use a proper patch management program to validate file versions and checksums before deploying 
        security patches; the patch management tool must be able to monitor the patched systems; the patch management team should check for updates and patches regularly</ul>
    </ol></p>
