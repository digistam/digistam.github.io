<h1>Web Server Attack Countermeasures</h1>
<h2>Place Web Servers in separate secure server security segment on network</h2>
<p>An ideal web hosting network should be designed with three segments:</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Internet segment</ul>
  <ul>Secure server security segment (<b>DMZ</b>b)</ul>
  <ul>Internal network</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>The first step in securing web servers is to place them separately in the DMZ, which is isolated from the public network and from the internal webhosting network.
Placing web servers in a separate segment adds security barriers between the web servers and the internal network as well as between the web servers and the outside public network. This separation allows the 
administrator to place firewalls and apply access control based on security rules for the internal network as well as for internet traffic toward the DMZ. Such a webhosting network can prevent attacks 
on the web server by outside attackers or malicious insiders.</p>
<p>Network segmentation divides a network into different segments, each having its own hub or switch. It allows protection by enforcing firewalls and security rules depending on the level of security desired.
An attacker who compromises one segment of the network will not be able to compromise the security of other segments of the network.</p>

<h2>Protocols and accounts</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Block all unnecessary ports, ICMP traffic and unnecessary protocols such as NetBIOS and SMB</ul>
  <ul>Harden the TCP/IP stack and consistently apply the latest software patches and updates to system software</ul>
</ol></p>
