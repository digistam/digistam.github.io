<h1>SNORT</h1>
<p>Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in DDoS attacks on the internet. Analysts search for possible attacks by examing IDS logs and packet captures and corroborating them with 
firewall logs, known vulnerabilities and general trending data from internet. The IDS checks traffic for suspicious activities that may indicate a network or system security breach. The IDS 
checks for signatures that match known intrusion patterns and signals an alarm when a match is detected. </p>
    <p><a target=_blank href=https://www.snort.org/downloads>Snort</a> is an open source network intrusion detection system (NIDS), capable of performing real time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP network. It can perform protocol analysis and 
    content searching / matching and is used to detect a variety of attacks and probes such as buffer overflows, stealth port scans, CGI attacks, SMB probes and OS fingerprinting attempts.
    It uses flexible rules language to describe traffic to collect or pass, as well as a detection engine that utilizes a modular plug-in architecture.</p>
