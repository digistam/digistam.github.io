<h1>Footprinting web infrastructure</h1>
<p>Footprinting the web infrastructure allows attackers to engage in the following tasks:</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>Server Discovery -> Whois, DNS interrogation, port scanning</ul>
 <ul>Service Discovery -> discover services to determine attack paths</ul>
 <ul>Server Identification -> bannergrabbing; helps to identify make and version of web server software</ul>
 <ul>Hidden content discovery -> extract content and functionality that is not directly linked to or reachable from main visible content</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Web Application Reconnaissance using Nmap and Telnet</h2>
<p>A professional hacker gathers as much information as possible about the target website by footprinting</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>Start Kali</ul>
 <ul>Perform a Whois lookup to gather information about the IP address of the web server and the complete information about the domain such as its registration details, name servers, IP address, locations</ul>
 <ul>Tools: Netcraft, SmartWhois, WHOIS Lookup, Batch IP Converter</ul>
 <ul>Perform DNS Interrogation to gather information about the DNS servers, DNS records and types of servers used by the target organization; DNS zone data include DNS domain names, computer names, IP addresses, 
 domain mail servers, service records etc.</ul>
 <ul>Tools: DNSRecon, DNS Records, Domain Dossier (centralops.net)</ul>
 <ul>Port scanning to gather information about the open ports and services running on the machine hosting the target website</ul>
 <ul><i>nmap -T4 -A -v www.moviescope.com</i> (-T4 specifies setting time template (0-5); -A aggressive scan; -v verbose output (include all hosts and ports in the output)</ul>
 <ul>View the target machine name, NetBIOS name, DNS name, MAC address, OS and other information</ul>
 <ul>Perform banner grabbing to identify the make, model and version of the target web server software:</ul>
 <ul><i>telnet www.moviescope.com 80</i></ul>
 <ul><i>GET / HTTP/1.0</i></ul>
 <ul>The make, model and version of the web server software will be revealed</ul>
 <ul>Now, we performed web application reconnaissance (Whois Lookup, DNS interrogation, port and services discovery, banner grabbing and firewall detection)</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Web Application Reconnaissance using WhatWeb</h2>
<p><a target=_blank href=https://whatweb.net/>WhatWeb</a> [<a target=_blank href=https://github.com/urbanadventurer/whatweb>GitHub</a>] identifies websites and recognizes web technologies, including CMS, blogging platforms etc.</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>Kali -> Console -> sudo whatweb</ul>
 <ul><i>whatweb www.moviescope.com</i></ul>
 <ul>The result shows a lot of interesting information, such as the website infrastructure, CMS, plugin versions and more !</ul>
 <ul><i>whatweb -i www.moviescope.com</i></ul>
 <ul>Using the -i flag, a detailed report on the target website is created in the console</ul>
 <ul><i>whatweb --log-verbose=MovieScope_Report www.moviescope.com</i></ul>
 <ul>This command will generate a very usable report with the name MovieScope_Report and saves this file in the current folder</ul>
 <ul>Attackers use this information to determine the website infrastructure and find underlying vulnerabilities and later exploit them to launch further attacks</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Performing Web Spidering using OWASP ZAP</h2>
<p>OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications. It offers automated scanners as well as a set of tools that allow you to find 
security vulnerabilities manually</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>Kali -> console -> sudo zaproxy</ul>
 <ul>After completing initialization -> Do you want to persist the ZAP Session ? -> No !</ul>
 <ul>Click the <b>Automated Scan</b> option under "Welcome to OWASP ZAP"</ul>
 <ul>The <b>Automated Scan</b> wizard appears; enter the target website under <b>URL to attack</b> -> Attack !</ul>
 <ul>OWASP ZAP starts scanning the target website (<b>spidering</b>)</ul>
 <ul>After performing web spidering, OWASP ZAP performs active scanning -> navigate to the <b>Active Scan</b> tab to observe the various scanned links</ul>
 <ul>After completing the active scan, the results appear under the <b>Alerts</b> tab, displaying the various vulnerabilities and issues associated with the target website</ul>
 <ul>Click on the <b>Spider</b> tab from the lower section to view the web spidering information; by default the URLs tab appears under the Spider tab </ul>
 <ul>The URLs tab contains various links for hidden content and functionality associated with the target website</ul>
 <ul>Navigate to the Messages tab under the Spider tab to view more detailed information regarding the URLs obtained while performing the web spidering</ul>
 <ul>Attackers perform web spidering or crawling to discover hidden content and functionality, which is not reachable from the main visible content, to exploit user privileges 
 within the application; it also allows attackers to recover backup copies of live files, configuration and log files containing sensitive data, backup archives containing snapshots of files within the 
 web root and new functionality that is not linked to the main application</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Detect Load Balancers</h2>
<p><ol>
 <ul><i>sudo dig yahoo.com</i></ul>
 <ul>If the result displays multiple IP addresses for the domain, it possibly indicates that the host is using a load balancer</ul>
 <ul>Kali has built-in tool <b>lbd</b> -> load balancing detector</ul>
 <ul><i>lbd yahoo.com</i></ul>
</ol></p>

<h1>Identify Web Server Directories using various tools</h1>
<p>Web servers host the web applications, therefore misconfigurations in the hosting of the web applications may lead to the exposure of critical files and directories. A professional hacker must identify 
the target web application's files and directories exposed on the internet using various automated tools such as Nmap, <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/OJ/gobuster>GoBuster</a> and <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch>Dirsearch</a>.</p>
<h2>Nmap</h2>
<p><ol>
 <ul><i>nmap -sV --script=http-enum www.moviescope.com</i></ul>
 <ul>The result shows open ports and services, along with their versions</ul>
 <ul>Observe the identified web server directories under the <b>http-enum</b> section</ul>
 <ul>Attackers use various techniques to detect the vulnerabilities in the target web applications hosted by the web servers either to gain admin level access or to retrieve sensitive information stored on the server</ul>
 <ul>The Nmap NSE script http-enum is often used to enumerate the applications, directories and files of the web servers that are exposed on the internet; through this method attackers identify critical security 
 vulnerabilities on the target web application</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>GoBuster</h2>
<p><i>sudo apt install gobuster</i></p>
<p>GoBuster can be used in combination with a wordlist; In order to do this create or download a wordlist file</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>gobuster dir -u www.moviescope.com -w /home/attacker/Desktop/common.txt</ul>
 <ul>In real-time, attackers use GoBuster to scan the target website for web server directories and perform fast-paced enumeration of the hidden files and directories of the target web application. 
 GoBuster is a command-oriented tool used to brute-force URIs in websites, DNS subdomains and names of virtual hosts on the target server</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>DirSearch</h2>
<p><i>sudo apt install dirsearch</i></p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>dirsearch -u www.moviescope.com</ul>
 <ul>dirsearch lists all the files and directories of the target website; it's very comprehensive </ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Vega Vulnerability Scanner</h2>
<p><a target=_blank href=https://subgraph.com/vega>Vega</a> is a free and open source web security scanner and web security testing platform to test the security of web applications. Vega can help you 
find and validate SQL Injection, XSS, inadvertently disclosed sensitive information and other vulnerabilities. </p>
<p>After the scanner finishes performing its vulnerability assessment on the target website, it lists the discovered vulnerabilities under <b>Scan Alert Summary</b></p>

<h1>Perform Web Application Attacks</h1>
<p>For a hacker, the next step after gathering required information about the target web application is to attack the web application. They must have the required knownledge to perform web application attacks 
to test the target network's web application security infrastructure.</p>

<h2>Perform a Brute-force Attack using Burp Suite</h2>
<p>Burp Suite is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. It has various tools that work together to support the entire testing process from the initial mapping and analysis of 
an application's attack surface to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities. </p>
