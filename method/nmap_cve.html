<h1>Detect CVEs using Nmap</h1>
  <p>source: <a target=_blank href=https://securitytrails.com/blog/nmap-vulnerability-scan>SecurityTrails</a></p>
<p><a target=_blank href=https://www.cve.org>CVE</a> stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. It is a publicly available and free-to-use list or dictionary of standardized identifiers for 
  common software vulnerabilities and exposures. The use of CVE IDs or CVE Identifiers, which are assigned by CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) from around the world, ensures confidence among parties when 
  discussing or sharing information about a unique software or firmware vulnerbility. CVE provides a baseline for tool evaluation and enables data exchange for cybersecurity automation. In short, products and services 
  compatible with CVE provide better coverage, easier interoperability and enhanced security.</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>One identifier for one vulnerability or exposure</ul>
    <ul>One standardized description for each vulnerability or exposure</ul>
    <ul>A dictionary rather than a database</ul>
    <ul>A method for disparate databases and tools to speak the same language</ul>
    <ul>The way to interoperability and better security coverage</ul>
    <ul>A basis for evaluation among services, tools and databases</ul>
    <ul>Free for the public to download and use</ul>
    <ul>Industry-endorsed via the CVE Numbering Authorities, CVE Board and the numerous products and services that include CVE</ul>
  </ol>
  <p>In plain English, that simply means it's a way to organize and categorize software vulnerabilities. This information can be highly useful for security researchers and penetration testers in their daily tasks. 
    Something we really love about the tool is its ability to expand its core features by using Nmap scripts. You might be wondering can Nmap find vulnerabilities. 
    Yes it can! By combining these Nmap commands with a few NSE scripts, we're able to fetch the most popular CVEs from any target. Two of the most popular vulnerability/CVE detection scripts found on Nmap NSE 
    are <b>nmap-vulners</b> and <b>vulscan</b>, which will enable you to detect relevant CVE information from <b>remote</b> or <b>local</b> hosts. Along with those two, the entire "vuln" category is an absolute 
    treasure trove — a truly useful resource when using Nmap as a vulnerability scan engine.</p>

  <h2>Nmap vulscan</h2>
<p>Vulscan queries its own local CVE databases, hosted on the client performing the scan. These local databases include the following files:</p> 
<p><ol>
  <ul>scipvuldb.csv</ul>
  <ul>cve.csv</ul>
  <ul>securityfocus.csv</ul>
  <ul>xforce.csv</ul>
  <ul>exploitdb.csv</ul>
  <ul>openvas.csv</ul>
  <ul>securitytracker.csv</ul>
  <ul>osvdb.csv</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>In order to use this NSE script, we'll need to clone its github repo</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts</ul>
    <ul>sudo git clone https://github.com/scipag/vulscan scipag_vulscan</ul>
    <ul>sudo ln -s `pwd`/scipag_vulscan /usr/share/nmap/scripts/vulscan</ul>
  </ol></p>
<p>Command: <i>nmap -sV --script=vulscan/vulscan.nse ethicalhacker.com</i></p>

<h2>Nmap-vulners</h2>
<p>Nmap-vulners is one of the most famous vulnerability scanners in use. Let's explore how to install this tool, as well as how to perform a simple CVE scan.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts/</ul>
  <ul>sudo git clone https://github.com/vulnersCom/nmap-vulners.git</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>
Command: <i>nmap --script nmap-vulners/ -sV 11.22.33.44</i>
</p>
<p>If you want to target specific posts, you simply need to add -p80 at the end, and replace "80" with the port you want to scan. And of course, replace 11.22.33.44 with your desired IP or TLD.</p>
<h2>Combine</h2>
<p>Command: <i>nmap --script nmap-vulners/,vulscan/ -sV yourwebsite.com</i></p>
<h2>Nmap vuln</h2>
<p>The way NSE scripts are defined is based on a list of predefined categories where each script belongs. These categories include:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>auth</ul>
    <ul>brute</ul>
    <ul>default</ul>
    <ul>discover</ul>
    <ul>dos</ul>
    <ul>exploit</ul>
    <ul>external</ul>
    <ul>fuzzer</ul>
    <ul>intrusive</ul>
    <ul>malware</ul>
    <ul>safe</ul>
    <ul>version</ul>
    <ul>vuln</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <p>Nmap script <b>vuln</b> is the one we’ll be using to launch our next scan against vulnerable subdomains. The syntax is the same as that of the previous NSE scripts, with 'vuln' added after '--script', 
    as you can see here:</p>
<p>Command: nmap -Pn --script vuln 192.168.1.105</p>
<p>Command: nmap -Pn --script vuln testphp.vulnweb.com -p 8443</p>
<p>Here, we launched a CVE scan against port 8443, but you can query other ports or the entire website as well</p>
