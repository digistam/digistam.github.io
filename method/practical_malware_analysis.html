<h1>Practical malware analysis</h1>
<h1>Static Malware Analysis</h1>
<h2>Hyrid Analysis</h2>
<p>HybridAnalysis.com is a free service that analyzes suspicious files and URLs and facilitates the quick detection of unknown threats such as viruses, 
Trojans and other kinds of malware.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Visit <a target=_blank href=https://www.hybrid-analysis.com>hybridanalysis.com</a></ul>
  <ul>Click Drag & Drop for instant analysis</ul>
  <ul>Select a file, analysis environment (Windows 11, 64bit) and press Generate Public Report</ul>
  <ul>After some time the Analysis Overview will show that it is a malicious file</ul>
  <ul>In the Anti-Virus Results section you can observe the AV result obtained from different online resources such as VirusTotal</ul>
  <ul>If VirusTotal is not listed, you can upload the file to <a target=_blank href=https://www.virustotal.com>VirusTotal</a></ul>
  <ul>In VirusTotal click DETAILS tab to view malicious file details such as Basic Properties (hash values), History, Names, Portable Executable info, 
  sections, Imports and ExifTool File Metadata</ul>
  <ul>Click RELATIONS tabl to view Execution Parents, PE Resource Parents, Contained in Graphs, Graph Summary etc.</ul>
  <ul>Click BEHAVIOR to view File System Actions, Process and Service Actions, Shell Commands, Synchronization Mechanisms, Signals etc. </ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Other local and online malware scanning tools:</p>

<h2>Perform a Strings Search using BinText</h2>
<p><a target=_blank href=https://github.com/mfput/McAfee-Tools/blob/master/McAfee%20tools%20info.txt>BinText</a> (McAfee) is a text extractor that can extract text from any file.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Search >> File to scan >> Browse >> Go</ul>
  <ul>The type of string is designated by a colored letter, ANSI strings are marked with a green A, Unicode strings have a red U and resource strings have a blue R</ul>
  <ul>File pos is the HEX position at which the text is located in the file</ul>
  <ul>Mem post fil the file is a Win32 PE file, then this is the HEX address at which the text is referred to in the memory at runtime as determined by its section tables</ul>
  <ul>ID is the decimal string resource ID or 0 if it is not a resource string</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Other strings tools:</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>FLOSS</ul>
  <ul>Strings Microsoft</ul>
  <ul>Free EXE DLL Resource Extract</ul>
  <ul>FileSeek</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Identify Packaging and Obfuscation Methods using PEid</h2>
<p>Attackers often use packing and obfuscation or a packer to compress, encrypt or modify a malware executable to avoid detection. Obfuscation also hides the 
execution of the programs. <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/wolfram77web/app-peid>PEid</a> is a free tool that provides details about Windows 
executable files. It can identify signatures associated with over 600 different packers and compilers.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Start PEid</ul>
  <ul>Browse for a file</ul>
  <ul>PEis analyzes the file and provides interesting information</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Analyze ELF Executable File using DIE (Detect It Easy)</h2>
<p>The executable and linkable format (ELF) is a generic executable file format in Linux environments. <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy>Detect It Easy (DIE)</a>
is an application used for determining the types of files. DIE is available for Windows, Linux and MAC OS.</p>
<p>Analyze an ELF file</p>
<p>Click File Info to observe File name, size, MD5, SHA1, Entropy, entry points etc.</p>
<p>Other packaging / obfuscation tools:</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Macro_Pack</ul>
  <ul>UPX</ul>
  <ul>ASPack</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Find Portable Executable (PE) information of a malware executable file using PE Explorer</h2>
<p><a target=_blank href=https://www.pe-explorer.com/>PE explorer</a> can open, view and edit a variety of different 32-bit Windows executable file types (PE 
files) ranging from common such as EXE, DLL and ActiveX to less familiar as CSR (screensaver), CPL (control panel applets), SYS, MSSTYLES, 
BPL, DPL etc.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Start PE Explorer</ul>
  <ul>Analyze a file</ul>
  <ul>Click Data Directories button</ul>
  <ul>Click Section Headers</ul>
  <ul>Double click on any section to view the raw content (hex viewer)</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Other PE Extraction tools:</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Portable Executable Scanner pescan</ul>
  <ul>Resource Hacker</ul>
  <ul>PEView</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Identify File Dependencies using Dependency Walker</h2>
<p><a target=_blank href=https://www.dependencywalker.com/>Dependency Walker</a> list all dependent modules of an executable file and builds hierarchical 
tree diagrams.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Start Dependency Walker</ul>
  <ul>Analyze a file</ul>
  <ul>Shrink the .DLL nodes to view all available DLLs for the malicious file</ul>
  <ul>The available DLLs for the file are listed in the left-pane</ul>
  <ul>Click on any DLL dependency to view the details of the DLL file</ul>
  <ul>As soon as you select the DLL, Dependency Walker displays the DLL details in the Import Section and Export Section</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Other dependency checking tools:</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Dependency-check</ul>
  <ul>Snyk</ul>
  <ul>RetireJS</ul>

<h2>Perform Malware disassembly using IDA and OllyDbg</h2>
<p>Static analysis also includes the dismantling of a given executable into binary format to study its functionalities and features. </p>
<p><a target=_blank href=https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/>IDA</a> is a disassembler which allows an analyst to single-step through the code 
being investigated. <a target=_blank href=https://www.ollydbg.de/>OllyDbg</a> is a debugger that emphasizes binary code analysis, useful when 
source code is unavailable. It can set breakpoints.</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Start IDA</ul>
    <ul>Disassemble a new file</ul>
    <ul>IDA completes the analysis of the imported malicious file and displays the results in the IDA View-A tab</ul>
    <ul>Use Text View to view the text information of the file</ul>
</ol></p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Start OllyDbg</ul>
    <ul>Open a file to analyze</ul>
    <ul>The output appears in a window named CPU - main thread</ul>
    <ul>View -> log</ul>
    <ul>The log data also displays the program entry point and its calls to known functions</ul>
    <ul>View -> Executable modules</ul>
    <ul>Double-click any module to view the complete information of the selected module</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Perform malware disassembly using Ghidra</h2>
<p><a target=_blank href=https://ghidra-sre.org/>Ghidra</a> is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework. </p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Start Ghidra</ul>
    <ul>Create new project -> Malware analysis</ul>
    <ul>File > Import file</ul>
    <ul>Ghidra starts to analyze the file</ul>
    <ul>After the analysis, assembly code of the file appears along with the decompiler</ul>
    <ul>In the left pane, under Symbol Tree, you can observe various components such as Imports, Exports, Functions and Labels</ul>
</ol></p>
