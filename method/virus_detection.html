<h2>Scanning</h2>
<p>A virus scanner is an essential software for detecting viruses. Run antivirus tools continuously and update on a regular base.</p>
<p>Once a virus is detected in the wild, antivirus vendors across the globe identify its signature strings (characteristics). The vendors start writing scanning programs that look for the virus'
signature strings. The resulting new scanners search memory files and system sectors for the signature strings and declare presence of the virus once it finds a match. Only known and 
predefined viruses can be detected.</p>
<p>Some scanners set up a virtual computer in a machine's RAM and test the programs by executing them in this virtual space. This technique, <b>heuristic scanning</b> can also check and 
remove messages that might contain a computer virus or other unwanted content.</p>

    <h2>Integrity Checking</h2>
    <p>Integrity checking products perform their functions by reading and recording integrated data to develop a signature or baseline for those files and system sectors. A disadvantage is 
    that it cannot differentiate file corruption caused by a bug from that caused by a virus.</p>

    <h2>Interception</h2>
    <p>The primary objective of an interceptor is to deflect logic bombs and Trojans. Some viruses can disable the monitoring program.</p>

    <h2>Code Emulation</h2>
    <p>Using code emulation, antivirus software executes a virtual machine to mimic CPU and memory activities. Virus code is executed on the virtual machine instead of the real processor.
    Code emulation deals with encrypted and polymorphic viruses. A drawback is that it is too slow if the decryption loop is very long.</p>

    <h2>Heuristic Analysis</h2>
    <p>This method helps in detecting new or unknown viruses that are usually variants of an already existing virus family. Heuristic analysis can be static or dynamic. In static analysis, 
    the antivirus tool analyzes the file format and code structure to determine if the code is viral. In dynamic analysis, the antivirus tool performs code emulation of the suspicious
    code to determine if the code is viral. A drawback of heuristic analysis is that it is prone to too many false positives.</p>
