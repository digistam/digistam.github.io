<h1>Covert TCP</h1>
  <p>Networks use network access control permissions to permit or deny the traffic flowing through them. Tunneling is used to bypass the access control rules of firewalls, IDS, IPS, and web proxies to allow certain traffic. 
    Covert channels can be created by inserting data into the unused fields of protocol headers. There are many unused or misused fields in TCP or IP over which data can be sent to bypass firewalls. The <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/zaheercena/Covert-TCP-IP-Protocol>Covert_TCP</a> program manipulates 
    the TCP/IP header of the data packets to send a file one byte at a time from any host to a destination. It can act like a server as well as a client and can be used to hide the data transmitted inside an IP header. This is useful 
    when bypassing firewalls and sending data with legitimate-looking packets that contain no data for sniffers to analyze.</p>
