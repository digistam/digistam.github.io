<h1>Sniffing Tools</h1>
<h2>Wireshark</h2>
    <p><a target=_blank href=https://www.wireshark.org/>Wireshark</a> lets you capture and interactively 
        browse the traffic running on a computer network. This tool uses WinPcap to capture packets on its own 
        supported networks. It captures live network data from Ethernet, IEEE 802.11, PPP/HDLC, ATM, 
        Bluetooth, USB, Token Ring, Frame Relay and FDDI networks. The captured files can be programmatically edited 
        via the command line. A set of filters for customized data display can be refined using a display filter. </p>

    
<h2>Follow TCP Stream in Wireshark</h2>
<p>Wireshark displays data from the TCP port with a feature known as "Follow TCP stream".
The tool sees TCP data in the same way as that of the application layer. Use this tool to find
passwords in a telnet session or to interpret a data stream.</p>
<p>To see the TCP stream, select a TCP packet in the packet list of a stream / connection an then 
select the <b>Follow</b> > <b>TCP Stream</b> menu item from the Wireshark <b>Analyze</b> menu. Wireshark displays all the 
data from the TCP stream by setting an appropriate display filter. The tool displays the streaming
content in the same sequence as it appeared on the network. It displays the captured data in ASCII, 
EBCDIC, hex dump, C array or raw format. Attackers can capture network traffic and gain the 
credentials of a target machine. They attempt to capture its remote interface and monitor the 
traffic generated from a user's browsing activities to extract confidential user information.</p>

    <h2>Display Filters in Wireshark</h2>
    <p>Wireshark features display filters that filter traffic on the target network by protocol 
    type, IP address, port etc. Display filters are used to change the view of packets in the captured files. 
    To set up a filter, type the protocol name, such as arp, http, tcp, udp, dns and ip in the filter box of 
    Wireshark. Wireshark can use multiple filters at a time.</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Display Filtering by Protocol:</ul> 
        <ul>arp, http, tcp, udp, dns, ip</ul>
        <ul>Monitoring Specific Ports:</ul>
        <ul>tcp.port==23</ul>

        <ul>ip.addr==192.168.1.100 && tcp.port==23</ul>
        <ul>Filtering by Multiple IP addresses:</ul>
        <ul>ip.addr==10.0.0.4 or ip.addr == 10.0.0.5</ul>
        <ul>Filtering by IP address:</ul>
        <ul>ip.addr == 10.0.0.4</ul>
        <ul>Other Filters:</ul>
