<h1>Cryptography</h1>
<p>Cryptography comes from the Greek words <b>kryptos</b> (concealed, hidden, veiled, secret, mysterious) and <b>graphia</b> (writing). Cryptography is 
"the art of secret writing". Cryptography is the practice if concealing information by converting plaintext into cyphertext.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Confidentiality -> information is only accessible to those authorized to access it</ul>
    <ul>Integrity -> trustworthiness of data or resources in terms of preventing improper and unauthorized changes</ul>
    <ul>Authentication -> assurance that the communication, document or data is genuine</ul>
    <ul>Nonrepudiation -> sender can't deny having sent the message and recipient can't deny having received the message</ul>
</ol></p>
<h1>Cryptography types</h1>
<p>Categorized in two types according to the <b>number of keys</b> employed for encryption and decryption</p>
<h2>Symmetric Encryption</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>One encryption key</ul>
    <ul>Also called: secret key cryptography</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Faster and easier to implement, as the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data</ul>
    <ul>Requires less processing power</ul>
    <ul>Can be implemented in ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Chip)</ul>
    <ul>Prevents widespread messages security compromise as different secret keys are used to communicate with different parties</ul>
    <ul>The key is not bound to the data being transferred on the link, even if the data is intercepted it is not possible to decrypt it</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Lack of secure channel to exchange the secret key</ul>
    <ul>Difficult to manage and secure too many shared keys that are generated to communicate with different parties</ul>
    <ul>Provides no assurance about the origin and authenticity of a message, as the same key is used by both sender and receiver</ul>
    <ul>Vulnerable to dictionary attacks and brute-force attacks</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Asymmetric Encryption</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Two keys -> public key and private key</ul>
    <ul>Also called: public key cryptography</ul>
    <ul>To meet the need for authentication: digital signatures</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Convenient to use, as the distribution of keys to encrypt messages is not required</ul>
    <ul>Enhanced security, as one need not share or transmit private keys to anyone</ul>
    <ul>Provides digital signatures that cannot be repudiated</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Slow in processing and requires high processing power</ul>
    <ul>Widespread message security compromise is possible (if private key is compromised)</ul>
    <ul>Messages received can't be decrypted if private key is lost</ul>
    <ul>Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle and brute-force attacks</ul>
</ol></p>

<h1>Government Access to Keys (GAK)</h1>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Software companies will give copies of all keys to the government</ul>
    <ul>Law Enforcement agencies around the world acquire and use these keys to monitor suspicious communication and collect evidence of cybercrimes in the 
    interests of national security</ul>
    <ul>Government promises that it will hold on the keys in a secure manner and only use them when a court issues a warrant to do so</ul>
    <ul>Similar to wiretap phones</ul>
    <ul>Government agencies often use key escrow for uninterrupted access to keys</ul>
    <ul>Growing concern about privacy and security of cryptographic keys and information</ul>
    <ul>Agencies generally use a single key to protect other keys, which is not a good idea, as revealing a single key could expose the other keys</ul>
    <ul>Agencies are NOT aware of how confidential the information protected by the keys is, which makes it difficult to judge how much protection is 
    required</ul>
</ol></p>
<h1>Background information</h1>
<h2>Birthday attack (2016)</h2>
<p>Cryptographic protocols like TLS, SSH, IPsec, and OpenVPN commonly use block cipher algorithms, such as AES, Triple-DES, and Blowfish, 
    to encrypt data between clients and servers. To use such algorithms, the data is broken into fixed-length chunks, called blocks, and each block is 
    encrypted separately according to a mode of operation. Older block ciphers, such as Triple-DES and Blowfish use a block size of 64 bits, 
    whereas AES uses a block size of 128 bits. It is well-known in the cryptographic community that a short block size makes a block cipher vulnerable to 
    birthday attacks, even if there are no cryptographic attacks against the block cipher itself. We observe that such attacks have now become practical 
    for the common usage of 64-bit block ciphers in popular protocols like TLS and OpenVPN. Still, such ciphers are widely enabled on the Internet. 
    Blowfish is currently the default cipher in OpenVPN, and Triple-DES is supported by nearly all HTTPS web servers, and currently used for roughly 
    1-2% of HTTPS connections between mainstream browsers and web servers. We show that a network attacker who can monitor a long-lived Triple-DES HTTPS 
    connection between a web browser and a website can recover secure HTTP cookies by capturing around 785 GB of traffic. In our proof-of-concept demo, 
    this attack currently takes less than two days, using malicious Javascript to generate traffic. Keeping a web connection alive for two days may not 
    seem very practical, but it worked easily in the lab. In terms of computational complexity, this attack is comparable to the recent attacks on RC4. 
    We also demonstrate a similar attack on VPNs that use 64-bit ciphers, such as OpenVPN, where long-lived Blowfish connections are the norm.</p>
    <h2>Difference between block size and key size</h2>
<p>Block ciphers operate on a fixed length string of bits. The lenght of the bit string is the <b>block size</b>. Both the input (plaintext) and output 
(ciphertext) are the <b>same length</b>; the output can't be shorter than the input. Until the announcement of NIST's AES contest, the majority of block 
ciphers followed the example of the DES in using a block size of 64 bit (8 bytes). However the <b>birthday paradox</b> indicates that after accumulating 
several blocks equal to the square root of the total number possible, there will be an approx. 50% chance of two or more being the same, which would 
start to leak information about the message contents. Consequently, AES candidates were required to support a block length of 128 bits (16 bytes).</p>
<p>Key size or key length refers to the number of bits in a key used by a cryptographic algorithm. Most symmetric-key algorithms are designed to have 
security equal to their key length.</p>

</ol></p>
<h2>Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES)</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>DES become more and more insecure</ul>
    <ul>Interim solution: 3DES</ul>
    <ul>3DES performs DES three times with three different keys</ul>
    <ul>3DES uses a "key bundle" (three 56-bit DES keys): K1, K2 and K3</ul>

</ol></p>

<h2>RC5</h2>
<p><ol>

</ol></p>

<h2>Blowfish</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Developed by Bruce Schneier</ul>
    <ul>Block cipher</ul>
    <ul>Symmetric algorithm</ul>
    <ul>Designed to replace DES or IDEA algorithms</ul>
    <ul>Significantly faster than DES and IDEA</ul>
    <ul>Unpatented and available free for all uses</ul>
    <ul>Recommended to use Blowfish not to encrypt files larger than 4GB in size, use TwoFish instead</ul>
    <ul>16-round Feistel cipher</ul>
    <ul>Block lengths of 64 bits</ul>
    <ul>Because of 64-bit block size vulnerable to <a target=_blank href=https://sweet32.info/>Sweet32 birthday attacks</a></ul>
    <ul>Variable key sizes 32 bits to 448 bits</ul>
    <ul>High speed and overall efficiency for use in software ranging from password protection tools to e-commerce websites for secure payments</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Blowfish algorithm has two parts:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>First part handles expansion of the key</ul>
    <ul>Second part encrypts the data</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>The key expansion is handled in several steps:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>First step: initialize P-array and S-boxes</ul>
    <ul>XOR P-array with the key bits:</ul>
    <ul>- P1 XOR (first 32 bits of the key)</ul>
    <ul>- P2 XOR (next 32 bits of the key)</ul>
    <ul>Encrypt the all-zero string</ul>
    <ul>New output is now P1 and P2</ul>
    <ul>Encrypt new P1 and P2 with modified subkeys</ul>
    <ul>New output is now P3 and P4</ul>
    <ul>Repeat process 521 times to calculate new subkeys for the P-array and the four S-boxes</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Message "Hiw world" encrypted with Blowfish</ul>
    <ul>Input consists of seven characters plus one space -> 8 bytes (64 bits)</ul>
    <ul>Input is split into 32 bits: left 32 bits "Hi w" are XORed with P1, which is generated by key expansion to create a value P1</ul>
    <ul>P1 runs through a transformative F-function (F In) in which the 32 bits are split into 4 bytes each and passed to the four S-boxes</ul>
    <ul>The first two values from the first two S-boxes are added to each other and XORed with the third value from the third X-box</ul>
    <ul>This result is added to the output of the fourth S-box to produce 32 bits as output</ul>
    <ul>The output of F In is XORed with the right 32 bits of the input message "orld" to produce output F1'</ul>
    <ul>F1' replaces the left half of the message, while P1' replaces the right half</ul>
    <ul>This same process is repeated for successive members of P-array for 16 rounds in total</ul>
    <ul>Finally, after 16 round, the outputs P16' and F16' are XORed with the last two entries of the P-array (P17 and P18)</ul>
    <ul>They are then recombined to produce the 64-bit ciphertext of the input message</ul>
</ol></p>

    <ul>All operations work on 64 bit words</ul>
    <ul>Threefish blocks 256, 512 and 1024 involve 72, 72 and 80 rounds of computations to achieve the final security goal</ul>
    <ul>Does not use S-boxes to prevent cache timing attacks</ul>

<h1>DSA and Related Signature Schemes</h1>
<p>The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a Federal Information Processing Standard for digital signatures. The NIST proposed the DSA for use in the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), adopted as FIPS 186. 
The DSA helps in the generation and verification of digital signatures for sensitive and unclassified applications. It creates a 320 bit digital signature with 512 - 1024 bit security. A digital signature is a 
mathematical scheme used for the authentication of digital messages.</p>
<h2>Processes involved in DSA</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Signature Generation Process -> the private key is used to know who has signed it</ul>
    <ul>Signature Verification Process -> the public key is used to verify whether the given digital signature is genuine</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>DSA is a public key cryptosystem, as it involves the use of both private and public keys</p>
<p>Benefits of DSA:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Less chance of forgery compared with a written signature</ul>
    <ul>Quick and easy method of business transactions</ul>
    <ul>Fake currency problem can be mitigated considerably</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA)</h2>
<p>Rivest, Shamir and Adleman formulated RSA, a public-key cryptosystem for internet encryption and authentication. The RSA system is widely used in a variety of products, platforms and industries. It is one of the 
defacto standards and used by companies as Microsoft, Apple, Sun and Novell. RSA can be found on hardware-secured phones, ethernet network cards and smart cards. </p>
<h2>Example RSA:</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>The sender of a message encrypts it using a randomly chosen DES symmetric key</ul>
    <ul>The sender looks up the recipient's public key and use it to encrypt the DES key using the RSA system</ul>
    <ul>The sender transmits a RSA digital envelope, consisting of a DES - encrypted message and a RSA - encrypted DES key, to the recipient</ul>
    <ul>The recipient will decrypt the DES key and then use the DES key to decrypt the message itself</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>This system combines the high speed of DES with the key management convenience of the RSA system.</p>

<h2>RSA Signature Scheme</h2>
<p>Cryptography uses RSA for public key encryption and for a digital signature (to sign a message and verify it). The RSA signature scheme is the first technique used to generate digital signatures. It is a deterministic 
digital signature scheme that provides message recovery from the signature itself, making it the most practical and versatile technique available.</p>
<p>RSA involves both a public key and a private key. The public key can be used by anyone for encrypting messages. The messages that the user encrypts with the public key require the private key for decryption.</p>

<h2>Diffie-Hellman</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Cryptographic protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared key over an insecure channel</ul>
    <ul>Does not provide any authentication for the key exchange and is vulnerable to many cryptographic attacks</ul>
    <ul>It is the basis of many authentication mechanisms, for example it provides forward secrecy in the TLS protocol</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>YAK</h2>
<p>YAK is a public key based Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocol. The authentication of YAK is based on public key pairs, and it needs PKI to distribute authentic public keys. YAK can accomplish:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Private key security</ul>
    <ul>Full forward secrecy</ul>
    <ul>Session key security</ul>
</ol></p>
