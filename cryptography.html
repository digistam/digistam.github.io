<h1>Cryptography</h1>
<p>Cryptography comes from the Greek words <b>kryptos</b> (concealed, hidden, veiled, secret, mysterious) and <b>graphia</b> (writing). Cryptography is 
"the art of secret writing". Cryptography is the practice if concealing information by converting plaintext into cyphertext.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Confidentiality -> information is only accessible to those authorized to access it</ul>
    <ul>Integrity -> trustworthiness of data or resources in terms of preventing improper and unauthorized changes</ul>
    <ul>Authentication -> assurance that the communication, document or data is genuine</ul>
    <ul>Nonrepudiation -> sender can't deny having sent the message and recipient can't deny having received the message</ul>
</ol></p>
<h1>Cryptography types</h1>
<p>Categorized in two types according to the <b>number of keys</b> employed for encryption and decryption</p>
<h2>Symmetric Encryption</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>One encryption key</ul>
    <ul>Also called: secret key cryptography</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Faster and easier to implement, as the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data</ul>
    <ul>Requires less processing power</ul>
    <ul>Can be implemented in ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Chip)</ul>
    <ul>Prevents widespread messages security compromise as different secret keys are used to communicate with different parties</ul>
    <ul>The key is not bound to the data being transferred on the link, even if the data is intercepted it is not possible to decrypt it</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Lack of secure channel to exchange the secret key</ul>
    <ul>Difficult to manage and secure too many shared keys that are generated to communicate with different parties</ul>
    <ul>Provides no assurance about the origin and authenticity of a message, as the same key is used by both sender and receiver</ul>
    <ul>Vulnerable to dictionary attacks and brute-force attacks</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Asymmetric Encryption</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Two keys -> public key and private key</ul>
    <ul>Also called: public key cryptography</ul>
    <ul>To meet the need for authentication: digital signatures</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Convenient to use, as the distribution of keys to encrypt messages is not required</ul>
    <ul>Enhanced security, as one need not share or transmit private keys to anyone</ul>
    <ul>Provides digital signatures that cannot be repudiated</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Slow in processing and requires high processing power</ul>
    <ul>Widespread message security compromise is possible (if private key is compromised)</ul>
    <ul>Messages received can't be decrypted if private key is lost</ul>
    <ul>Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle and brute-force attacks</ul>
</ol></p>

<h1>Government Access to Keys (GAK)</h1>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Software companies will give copies of all keys to the government</ul>
    <ul>Law Enforcement agencies around the world acquire and use these keys to monitor suspicious communication and collect evidence of cybercrimes in the 
    interests of national security</ul>
    <ul>Government promises that it will hold on the keys in a secure manner and only use them when a court issues a warrant to do so</ul>
    <ul>Similar to wiretap phones</ul>
    <ul>Government agencies often use key escrow for uninterrupted access to keys</ul>
    <ul>Growing concern about privacy and security of cryptographic keys and information</ul>
    <ul>Agencies generally use a single key to protect other keys, which is not a good idea, as revealing a single key could expose the other keys</ul>
    <ul>Agencies are NOT aware of how confidential the information protected by the keys is, which makes it difficult to judge how much protection is 
    required</ul>
</ol></p>
<h1>Background information</h1>
<h2>Birthday attack (2016)</h2>
<p>Cryptographic protocols like TLS, SSH, IPsec, and OpenVPN commonly use block cipher algorithms, such as AES, Triple-DES, and Blowfish, 
    to encrypt data between clients and servers. To use such algorithms, the data is broken into fixed-length chunks, called blocks, and each block is 
    encrypted separately according to a mode of operation. Older block ciphers, such as Triple-DES and Blowfish use a block size of 64 bits, 
    whereas AES uses a block size of 128 bits. It is well-known in the cryptographic community that a short block size makes a block cipher vulnerable to 
    birthday attacks, even if there are no cryptographic attacks against the block cipher itself. We observe that such attacks have now become practical 
    for the common usage of 64-bit block ciphers in popular protocols like TLS and OpenVPN. Still, such ciphers are widely enabled on the Internet. 
    Blowfish is currently the default cipher in OpenVPN, and Triple-DES is supported by nearly all HTTPS web servers, and currently used for roughly 
    1-2% of HTTPS connections between mainstream browsers and web servers. We show that a network attacker who can monitor a long-lived Triple-DES HTTPS 
    connection between a web browser and a website can recover secure HTTP cookies by capturing around 785 GB of traffic. In our proof-of-concept demo, 
    this attack currently takes less than two days, using malicious Javascript to generate traffic. Keeping a web connection alive for two days may not 
    seem very practical, but it worked easily in the lab. In terms of computational complexity, this attack is comparable to the recent attacks on RC4. 
    We also demonstrate a similar attack on VPNs that use 64-bit ciphers, such as OpenVPN, where long-lived Blowfish connections are the norm.</p>
    <h2>Difference between block size and key size</h2>
<p>Block ciphers operate on a fixed length string of bits. The lenght of the bit string is the <b>block size</b>. Both the input (plaintext) and output 
(ciphertext) are the <b>same length</b>; the output can't be shorter than the input. Until the announcement of NIST's AES contest, the majority of block 
ciphers followed the example of the DES in using a block size of 64 bit (8 bytes). However the <b>birthday paradox</b> indicates that after accumulating 
several blocks equal to the square root of the total number possible, there will be an approx. 50% chance of two or more being the same, which would 
start to leak information about the message contents. Consequently, AES candidates were required to support a block length of 128 bits (16 bytes).</p>
<p>Key size or key length refers to the number of bits in a key used by a cryptographic algorithm. Most symmetric-key algorithms are designed to have 
security equal to their key length.</p>

</ol></p>

<h2>Blowfish</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Developed by Bruce Schneier</ul>
    <ul>Block cipher</ul>
    <ul>Symmetric algorithm</ul>
    <ul>Designed to replace DES or IDEA algorithms</ul>
    <ul>Significantly faster than DES and IDEA</ul>
    <ul>Unpatented and available free for all uses</ul>
    <ul>Recommended to use Blowfish not to encrypt files larger than 4GB in size, use TwoFish instead</ul>
    <ul>16-round Feistel cipher</ul>
    <ul>Block lengths of 64 bits</ul>
    <ul>Because of 64-bit block size vulnerable to <a target=_blank href=https://sweet32.info/>Sweet32 birthday attacks</a></ul>
    <ul>Variable key sizes 32 bits to 448 bits</ul>
    <ul>High speed and overall efficiency for use in software ranging from password protection tools to e-commerce websites for secure payments</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Blowfish algorithm has two parts:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>First part handles expansion of the key</ul>
    <ul>Second part encrypts the data</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>The key expansion is handled in several steps:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>First step: initialize P-array and S-boxes</ul>
    <ul>XOR P-array with the key bits:</ul>
    <ul>- P1 XOR (first 32 bits of the key)</ul>
    <ul>- P2 XOR (next 32 bits of the key)</ul>
    <ul>Encrypt the all-zero string</ul>
    <ul>New output is now P1 and P2</ul>
    <ul>Encrypt new P1 and P2 with modified subkeys</ul>
    <ul>New output is now P3 and P4</ul>
    <ul>Repeat process 521 times to calculate new subkeys for the P-array and the four S-boxes</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Message "Hiw world" encrypted with Blowfish</ul>
    <ul>Input consists of seven characters plus one space -> 8 bytes (64 bits)</ul>
    <ul>Input is split into 32 bits: left 32 bits "Hi w" are XORed with P1, which is generated by key expansion to create a value P1</ul>
    <ul>P1 runs through a transformative F-function (F In) in which the 32 bits are split into 4 bytes each and passed to the four S-boxes</ul>
    <ul>The first two values from the first two S-boxes are added to each other and XORed with the third value from the third X-box</ul>
    <ul>This result is added to the output of the fourth S-box to produce 32 bits as output</ul>
    <ul>The output of F In is XORed with the right 32 bits of the input message "orld" to produce output F1'</ul>
    <ul>F1' replaces the left half of the message, while P1' replaces the right half</ul>
    <ul>This same process is repeated for successive members of P-array for 16 rounds in total</ul>
    <ul>Finally, after 16 round, the outputs P16' and F16' are XORed with the last two entries of the P-array (P17 and P18)</ul>
    <ul>They are then recombined to produce the 64-bit ciphertext of the input message</ul>
</ol></p>

    <ul>All operations work on 64 bit words</ul>
    <ul>Threefish blocks 256, 512 and 1024 involve 72, 72 and 80 rounds of computations to achieve the final security goal</ul>

<h1>DSA and Related Signature Schemes</h1>
<p>The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a Federal Information Processing Standard for digital signatures. The NIST proposed the DSA for use in the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), adopted as FIPS 186. 
The DSA helps in the generation and verification of digital signatures for sensitive and unclassified applications. It creates a 320 bit digital signature with 512 - 1024 bit security. A digital signature is a 
mathematical scheme used for the authentication of digital messages.</p>
<h2>Processes involved in DSA</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Signature Generation Process -> the private key is used to know who has signed it</ul>
    <ul>Signature Verification Process -> the public key is used to verify whether the given digital signature is genuine</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>DSA is a public key cryptosystem, as it involves the use of both private and public keys</p>
<p>Benefits of DSA:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Less chance of forgery compared with a written signature</ul>
    <ul>Quick and easy method of business transactions</ul>
    <ul>Fake currency problem can be mitigated considerably</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA)</h2>
<p>Rivest, Shamir and Adleman formulated RSA, a public-key cryptosystem for internet encryption and authentication. The RSA system is widely used in a variety of products, platforms and industries. It is one of the 
defacto standards and used by companies as Microsoft, Apple, Sun and Novell. RSA can be found on hardware-secured phones, ethernet network cards and smart cards. </p>
<h2>Example RSA:</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>The sender of a message encrypts it using a randomly chosen DES symmetric key</ul>
    <ul>The sender looks up the recipient's public key and use it to encrypt the DES key using the RSA system</ul>
    <ul>The sender transmits a RSA digital envelope, consisting of a DES - encrypted message and a RSA - encrypted DES key, to the recipient</ul>
    <ul>The recipient will decrypt the DES key and then use the DES key to decrypt the message itself</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>This system combines the high speed of DES with the key management convenience of the RSA system.</p>

<h2>RSA Signature Scheme</h2>
<p>Cryptography uses RSA for public key encryption and for a digital signature (to sign a message and verify it). The RSA signature scheme is the first technique used to generate digital signatures. It is a deterministic 
digital signature scheme that provides message recovery from the signature itself, making it the most practical and versatile technique available.</p>
<p>RSA involves both a public key and a private key. The public key can be used by anyone for encrypting messages. The messages that the user encrypts with the public key require the private key for decryption.</p>

<h2>Diffie-Hellman</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Cryptographic protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared key over an insecure channel</ul>
    <ul>Does not provide any authentication for the key exchange and is vulnerable to many cryptographic attacks</ul>
    <ul>It is the basis of many authentication mechanisms, for example it provides forward secrecy in the TLS protocol</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>YAK</h2>
<p>YAK is a public key based Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocol. The authentication of YAK is based on public key pairs, and it needs PKI to distribute authentic public keys. YAK can accomplish:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Private key security</ul>
    <ul>Full forward secrecy</ul>
    <ul>Session key security</ul>
</ol></p>

<h1>Message Digest (One-way Hash) Functions</h1>
<p>Hash functions calculate a unique fixed-size bit string representation, called a message digest, of any arbitrary block of information. Message digest functions distill the information contained in a file (small or large) 
into a single fixed-length number, typically between 128 and 256 bits. If any given bit of the function's input is changed, every output bit has a 50% chance of changing. Given an input file and its corresponding message digest, 
it should be nearly impossible to find another file with the same message digest value, as it is computationally infeasable to have two files with the same message digest value.</p>
<p>Message digest functions are also called one-way hash functions because they produce values that are nearly impossible to invert, resistant to attack, mostly unique and widely distributed. Message digest algorithms themselves 
do not participate in encryption and decryption operations. They allow the creation of digital signatures and message authentication codes (<b>MACs</b>) as well as the derivation of encryption keys from passphrases.</p>
<p>The main role of a cryptographic hash function is to provide <b>integrity in document management</b>. Crytographic hash functions are an integral part of digital signatures. They are relatively faster than digital signature 
algorithms, hence their characteristic feature is to calculate the signature of the document's hash value, which is smaller than the document. In addition, digests help to hide the contents or source of the document. Widely used 
message digest functions include:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>MD5</ul>
    <ul>SHA</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>MD4, MD5 and MD6</h2>
<p>MD2, MD4, MD5 and MD6 are message digest algorithms used in digital signature applications to compress a document securely before the system signs it with a private key. The algorithms can be of variable length but the 
resulting message digest always has a size of <b>128 bits</b>. MD2 supports 8 bit machines, while MD4 and MD5 support 32 bit machines. The algorithm pads the message with extra bits to ensure that the number of bits is 
<b>divisible by 512</b>. The extra bits may include a 64 bit binary message. MD4 can be cracked within a minute on a typical pc using collision attacks.</p>
<h2>Collision Attack</h2>
<p>In cryptography, a collision attack on a cryptographic hash tries to find two inputs producing the same hash value, i.e. a hash collision. 
This is in contrast to a preimage attack where a specific target hash value is specified. Much like symmetric-key ciphers are vulnerable to brute force 
attacks, every cryptographic hash function is inherently vulnerable to collisions using a birthday attack. Due to the birthday problem, these attacks are 
much faster than a brute force would be. A hash of n bits can be broken in 2n/2 time steps (evaluations of the hash function). Mathematically stated, a collision 
attack finds two different messages m1 and m2, such that hash(m1) = hash(m2). In a classical collision attack, the attacker has no control over the content of 
either message, but they are arbitrarily chosen by the algorithm. More efficient attacks are possible by employing cryptanalysis to specific hash functions. 
When a collision attack is discovered and is found to be faster than a birthday attack, a hash function is often denounced as "broken". 
The NIST hash function competition was largely induced by published collision attacks against two very commonly used hash functions, MD5[1] and SHA-1. 
The collision attacks against MD5 have improved so much that, as of 2007, it takes just a few seconds on a regular computer. 
Hash collisions created this way are usually constant length and largely unstructured, so cannot directly be applied to attack widespread document formats or protocols.</p>
<h2>MD5</h2>
<p>MD5 is slightly more secure than MD4. However, both the message digest size and the padding requirements remain the same. MD5 is widely used. It takes a message of arbitrary length as input and outputs a 
128 bit (16 byte) fingerprint or message digest of the input. MD5 is not collision resistant; therefore it is better to use the latest algorithms, such as MD6, SHA-2 and SHA-3.</p>
<h2>MD6</h2>
<p>MD6 uses a Merkle-tree like structure to allow for large-scale parallel computation of hashes for very long inputs. It is resistant to different cryptanalysis attacks.</p>

<h2>Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA)</h2>
<p>NIST has developed SHA. It generates a cryptographically secure one-way hash. Rivest developed SHA, which is similar to the MD5 family. It is slightly slower but its larger message digest makes it more secure against 
brute-force collision and inversion attacks. </p>
<p>SHA encryption is a series of five different cryptographic functions, and it currently has three <b>generations</b>: SHA-1, SHA-2 and SHA-3.</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>SHA-0 -> withdrawn due to an undisclosed significant flaw</ul>
    <ul>SHA-1 -> 160 bit hash function that resembles MD5 developed by Ron Rivest; produces a 160 bit digest from a message with a maximum length of (264 - 1) bits. It was designed by the NSA to be part of DSA. It is most 
    commonly used in security protocols such as PGP, GPG, TLS, SSH and SSL; As of 2010 SHA-1 is no longer approved for cryptographic use because of its cryptographic weaknesses</ul>
    <ul>SHA-2 -> family of two similar hash functions with different block sizes: SHA-256 (32 bit words) and SHA-512 (64 bit words); Truncated versions of each standard are SHA-224 and SHA-384</ul>
    <ul>SHA-3 -> uses sponge construction in which message blocks are XORed into the initial bits of the state, which the algorithm then invertibly permates. It supports the same hash lengths as SHA-2 but differs
    in its internal structure considerably from the rest of the SHA family</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>RIPEMD-160</h2>
<p>RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest (RIPEMD) is a 160 bit hash algorithm. There exist 128-, 256- and 320-bit versions of this algorithm, named RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-256 and RIPEMD-320. These 
algorithms replace the original RIPEMD, which was found to have a collision issue. They do NOT follow any standard security policies or guidelines. RIPEMD-160 is a more secure version of the RIPEMD algorithm.</p>

<h2>HMAC</h2>
<p>Hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) is a type of message authentication code (MAC) that uses a cryptographic key along with a cryptographic hash function. It is widely used to verify the integrity of data 
    and authentication of a message. This algorithm includes an embedded hash function such as SHA-1 or MD5. The strength of HMAC depends on the embedded hash function, key size and size of hash output.</p>
    <p>HMAC includes two stages for computing the hash. The input key is processed to produce two keys, namely the inner key and the outer key. The first stage of the algorithm inputs the output from the first stage 
    and outer key, and produces the final HMAC code. As HMAC executes the underlying hash function twice, it offers protection against various length extension attacks. The size of the key and the output depends on the 
    embedded hash function; 128 or 160 bits in the case of MD5 of SHA-1 respectively.</p>

    <h2>CHAP</h2>
    <p>Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) is an authentication mechanism used by Point-to-Point (PPP) servers to authenticate or validate the identity of remote clients or network hosts. It is more secure 
    and effective compared to Password Authentication Procedure (PAP), as it regularly verifies the identity of the client using a three-way handshake and provides protection against replay attacks.</p>

    <h2>EAP</h2>
    <p>Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) was originally designed for point-to-point connections. Is is used as an alternative to the CHAP and PAP authentication protocols, as it is more secure and supports 
    different authentication mechanisms such as passwords, smart tokens, one-time passwords (OTP), secure ID card, digital certificates and public-key encryption mechanisms. After the selection of the EAP authentication 
    mechanism, a session is established and messages are exchanged between the client and the authenticating server.</p>

    <h2>GOST - Hash Function</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Fixed-length output of 256 bits</ul>
        <ul>Input message is broken up into chunks of 256 bit blocks</ul>
        <ul>If a block is less than 256 bits, the message is padded by appending as many zeros to it as are required to make the length of the message 256 bits</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h1>Other Encryption Techniques</h1>
    <h2>Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Modern public key cryptography developed to avoid larger cryptographic key usage</ul>
        <ul>Asymmetric cryptosystem depends on number theory and mathematical elliptic curves (algebraic structure) to generate short, quick and robust keys</ul>
        <ul>To compare: RSA key size is large !</ul>
        <ul>Smaller key length allows faster encryption</ul>
        <ul>ECC has been proposed as a replacement for RSA</ul>
        <ul>ECC Key size 160 -> RSA Key size 1024</ul>
        <ul>ECC Key size 224 -> RSA Key size 2048</ul>
        <ul>ECC Key size 256 -> RSA Key size 3072</ul>
        <ul>ECC Key size 384 -> RSA Key size 7680</ul>
        <ul>ECC Key size 512 -> RSA Key size 15360</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>While RSA uses a key size of 1024 to encrypt the data, ECC provides equal security with a comparatively smaller key size of 160 !</p>

    <h2>Quantum Cryptography</h2>
    <p>Since mathematical encryption uses binary digits (0 and 1), it can be easily eavesdropped on or manipulated using various techniques. Quantum Cryptography has been introduced to protect data from MITM etc. 
    This cryptography is processed based on quantum mechanics, such as quantum key distribution QKD using <b>photons</b> instead of mathematics as a part of encryption. To breach this mechanism, attackers have to know 
    the exact shape of the photons; if they fail to choose the right transmission, the photon polarization is distorted and the receiver detects an error indicating the eavesdrop.</p>

    <h2>Homomorphic Encryption</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Homographic encryption allows users to secure and leave their data in an encrypted format even while it is being processed of manipulated</ul>
        <ul>Encryption and decryption performed by the same key holder</ul>
        <ul>Enables user / sender to encrypt the confidential data and out-source it to an enterprise via cloud services to process the data</ul>
        <ul>In conventional encryption mechanisms:</ul>
        <ul>- In private key encryption: only keyholders can generate and decrypt ciphertexts using similar keys</ul>
        <ul>- In public key encryption: only the public keyholder generates the ciphertext and the secret keyholder decrypts the ciphertext</ul>
        <ul>In homomorphic encryption:</ul>
        <ul>- keyholder can generate the ciphertext and anyone can alter the ciphertext, but only the keyholder again can decrypt the data</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>Hardware based encryption</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Uses computer hardware for assisting or replacing the software when the data encryption process is being performed</ul>
        <ul>Devices that offer encryption techniques can be considered as hardware-based encryption devices</ul>
        <ul>These devices do not support third-party software, thereby preventing the execution of any malicious programs</ul>
        <ul>Hardware encryption offers many advantages over software encryption</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>Types:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>TPM (Trusted Platform Module) -> cryptoprocessor or chip present in the motherboard</ul>
        <ul>HSM (Hardware Security Module) -> additional external security device used in a system for crypto processing</ul>
        <ul>USB Encryption -> Kingston Ironkey etc.</ul>
        <ul>Hard drive encryption -> data stored on the hdd can be encrypted using a wide range of encryption options; Hard drive encryption needs a TPM or HSM</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <h2>Post-quantum Cryptography</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Also known as quantum-resistant and quantum-proof cryptography; advanced cryptographic algorithm (mostly public-key based) designed to protect security systems from attacks initiated on both conventional and quantum 
        computers. It is aimed at preparedness for the age of quantum computing by updating specific algorithms and standards.</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <h2>Lightweight Cryptography</h2>
    <p>A major challenge in current cryptography techniques is its usage in low-powered devices (IoT). Researchers are attempting to develop a compact algorithm that is quantum-safe and can be operated effectively on low-powered 
    devices, such as RFID tags, sensors and other IoT applications.</p>

<h1>Cipher Modes of Operation</h1>
<p>Cipher modes of operation, also known as block cipher mode of operation, are used to encrypt a fixed block of plaintext using a secret key and, in some modes, an initialization vector.</p>
<h2>Electronic Code Book (ECB) Mode</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>straightforwarded process -> plaintext, secret key and block cipher encryption algorithm</ul>
    <ul>Decryption is performed in the same manner as generation of the first block of ciphertext; Secret key is taken as input to the block cipher decryption algorithm, which outputs the first block of plaintext</ul>
    <ul>Flaw: if equally partitioned blocks of plaintext contain the same data, the output of cipher blocks also contain the same ciphertext, providing a chance to predict the plaintext</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Improvement over ECB that rectifies most of the security flaws in ECB</ul>
    <ul>CBC requires an initialization vector and a secret key</ul>
    <ul>Problem: if one generated ciphertext block has an error, it propagates to the subsequent cipher blocks</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Cipher Feedback (CFB) Mode </h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Previously generated ciphertext is used as feedback for the encryption algorithm to encrypt the next plaintext block to ciphertext</ul>
    <ul>Advantage: it makes cryptanalysis difficult as it has some data loss because of the use of shift registers</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Counter Mode</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Block cipher mode of operation that uses a counter value in the encryption and decryption process</ul>
    <ul>Eliminates the problem of error propagation because it does not use previously generated ciphertext in encryption or decryption</ul>
    <ul>Requires synchronized counter values on both the source and destination sides</ul>
</ol></p>
