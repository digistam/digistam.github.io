<h1>Torrents</h1>
<p>Torrents are a method of distributing files over the internet. They operate over the BitTorrent protocol to facilitate what's called peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing.
There are a number of benefits torrent-based file sharing has over traditional file sharing. Expensive server equipment isn't necessary to send files to many people at once, 
and low-bandwidth (slow) networks can just as easily download large sets of data. The most common way to use torrents is through a special file that uses the .TORRENT file 
extension. Within the file are directions for how to share specific data with other people. It's important to remember that unless you can trust the source, it's far too easy 
to accidentally download files that weren't uploaded with the proper legal permission or even download files infected with malware. If you're interested in using torrents to share 
your own files or to download large files from other people, stay safe with an antivirus program and only download torrents from users you trust.</p>
<h2>Magnet links</h2>
<p>A magnet link is a hyperlink that contains the magnet identifier, file name, and cryptographic content hash in place of the . torrent file extension and mechanism. 
The content hash, which functions like an ISBN number, is computed from the contents in the file itself and can be used to track data across servers.</p>
