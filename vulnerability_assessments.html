<h1><b>Vulnerability Assessments</b></h1>
<h2>Active Assessment</h2>
<p>uses network scanners to identify hosts, services and vulnerabilities present in a network. Active network scanners can reduce the intrusiveness of the checks they perform. </p>
<h2>Passive Assessment</h2>
<p>Sniff the traffic present on the network to identify the active systems, network services, applications and vulnerabilities. Passive assessments also provide a list of the users who are currently accessing the network.</p>
<h2>External Assessment</h2>
<p>Examines the network from a hacker's point of view to identify exploits and vulnerabilities accessible to the outside world. Using external devices such as firewalls, routers and servers. 
<ol><ul>
  Determine a set or rules for firewall and router configurations for the external network</ul>
<ul>Check whether the external server devices and network devices are mapped</ul>
  <ul>Identify open ports and related services on the external network</ul>
  <ul>Examine the patch levels on the server and external network devices</ul>
  <ul>Review detection systems such as IDS, firewalls and application-layer protection systems</ul>
  <ul>Get information on DNS zones</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Internal Assessment</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Specify open ports and related services on network devices, servers and systems</ul>
  <ul>check router configurations and firewall rule set</ul>
  <ul>List internal vulnerabilities of OS and server</ul>
  <ul>Scan for any trojans that may be present in the internal environment</ul>
  <ul>Check patch levels on the internal network devices, servers and systems</ul>
  <ul>Check for existence of malware, spyware and virus activity and document them</ul>
  <ul>Evaluate the physical security</ul>
  <ul>Identify and review the remote management process and events</ul>
  <ul>Assess the file-sharing mechanisms (NFS, SMB/CIFS shares)</ul>
  <ul>Examine the antivirus implementations and events</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Host-based Assessment</h2>
<p>Configuration level check to identify system configurations, user directories, file systems, registry settings and other parameters to evaluate the possibility of compromise.</p>
<h2>Network bases Assessment</h2>
<p>Determine possible network security attacks. Discover network resources and map ports and services running to various areas on the network. Think of missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, weak encryption. Use network scanners such as <a target=_blank href=https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus>Nessus</a>. A typical network assesment:
<ol>
  <ul>Check network topologies for inappropriate firewall configuration</ul>
  <ul>Examine router filtering rules</ul>
  <ul>Identify inappropriately configured database servers</ul>
  <ul>Test individual services and protocols such as HTTP, SNMP, FTP</ul>
  <ul>Review HTML source code for unnecessary information</ul>
  <ul>Perform bounds checking on variables</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Application</h2>
<p>Focus on traditional Web applications, traditional client-server applications and hybrid systems. Analysis of all elements of an application infrastructure. </p>
