<h1><b>Vulnerability Assessments</b></h1>
<h2>Active Assessment</h2>
<p>uses network scanners to identify hosts, services and vulnerabilities present in a network. Active network scanners can reduce the intrusiveness of the checks they perform. </p>
<h2>Passive Assessment</h2>
<p>Sniff the traffic present on the network to identify the active systems, network services, applications and vulnerabilities. Passive assessments also provide a list of the users who are currently accessing the network.</p>
<h2>External Assessment</h2>
<p>Examines the network from a hacker's point of view to identify exploits and vulnerabilities accessible to the outside world. Using external devices such as firewalls, routers and servers. 
<ol><ul>
  Determine a set or rules for firewall and router configurations for the external network</ul>
<ul>Check whether the external server devices and network devices are mapped</ul>
  <ul>Identify open ports and related services on the external network</ul>
  <ul>Examine the patch levels on the server and external network devices</ul>
  <ul>Review detection systems such as IDS, firewalls and application-layer protection systems</ul>
  <ul>Get information on DNS zones</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Internal Assessment</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Specify open ports and related services on network devices, servers and systems</ul>
  <ul>check router configurations and firewall rule set</ul>
  <ul>List internal vulnerabilities of OS and server</ul>
  <ul>Scan for any trojans that may be present in the internal environment</ul>
  <ul>Check patch levels on the internal network devices, servers and systems</ul>
  <ul>Check for existence of malware, spyware and virus activity and document them</ul>
  <ul>Evaluate the physical security</ul>
  <ul>Identify and review the remote management process and events</ul>
  <ul>Assess the file-sharing mechanisms (NFS, SMB/CIFS shares)</ul>
  <ul>Examine the antivirus implementations and events</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Host-based Assessment</h2>
<p>Configuration level check to identify system configurations, user directories, file systems, registry settings and other parameters to evaluate the possibility of compromise.</p>
<h2>Network bases Assessment</h2>
<p>Determine possible network security attacks. Discover network resources and map ports and services running to various areas on the network. Think of missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, weak encryption. Use network scanners such as <a target=_blank href=https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus>Nessus</a>. A typical network assesment:
<ol>
  <ul>Check network topologies for inappropriate firewall configuration</ul>
  <ul>Examine router filtering rules</ul>
  <ul>Identify inappropriately configured database servers</ul>
  <ul>Test individual services and protocols such as HTTP, SNMP, FTP</ul>
  <ul>Review HTML source code for unnecessary information</ul>
  <ul>Perform bounds checking on variables</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Application Assessment</h2>
<p>Focus on traditional Web applications, traditional client-server applications and hybrid systems. Analysis of all elements of an application infrastructure. This assessment tests the webserver infrastructure for any misconfiguration, outdated content or known vulnerabilities. Both commercial and open source tools are used to do this assessment.</p>
<h2>Database Assessment</h2>
<p>Testing databases for misconfigurations or known vulnerabilities. Think of MSSQL, MYSQL, ORACLE, POSTGRESQL. Both commercial and open source tools to do the assessment.</p>
<h2>Wireless Network Assessment</h2>
<p>In the past, Wireless networks used weak and defective encryption. Standards have been evolved but many networks still use weak and outdated security and are open to attack. This type of assessment tests wireless networks and identifies 
rogue networks that may exist within an organization's perimeter. They sniff wireless network traffic and try to crack encryption keys.</p>
<h2>Distributed Assessment</h2>
<p>Employed by organizations that possess assets like servers and clients at different locations. Simultaneously assessing the distributed assets, such as client and server applications, using synchronization techniques.</p>
<h2>Credentialed Assessment</h2>
<p>Also called authenticated assessment. The ethical hacker possesses the credentials of all machines in the network. Chances of finding vulnerabilities are higher. Challenging because it is highly unclear who owns particular assets in large enterprises. 
Asset owners do not share such confidential information and passwords can be changed. It's the best way of assessing a target enterprise network and is highly reliable. Complex and challenging.</p>
<h2>Non-Credentialed Assessment</h2>
<p>Also called unauthenticated assessment. Quick overview of weaknesses by analyzing network services exposed by the host. It generates a brief report regarding vulnerabilities. Not reliable because it does not provide deeper insight into the OS and application vulnerabilities that are not exposed by the host to the network. 
Incapable of detecting vulnerabilities potentially covered by firewalls. Prone to false positives.</p>
<h2>Manual Assessment</h2>
<p>Ranking vulnerabilities and score them by referring to vulnerability scoring standards like CVSS and vulnerability databases like CVE and CWE.</p>
<h2>Automated Assessment</h2>
<p>Tools like <a target=_blank href=https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus>Nessus Professional</a>, <a target=_blank href=https://www.qualys.com/>Qualys</a>, <a target=_blank href=https://www.gfi.com/products-and-solutions/network-security-solutions/languard>GFI LanGuard</a>. Not performing footprinting and network scanning. </p>
<h2>Cloud-based Assessment</h2>
<p>Identifying cloud infrastructure vulnerabilities and mitigating them through access control mechanisms and proper security measures complying with standards.</p>
<h2>Mobile Application Assessment</h2>
<p>Protecting privacy of data across mobile applications and APIs. Examining source code and internal security controls of mobile applications.</p>

<h1>Vulnerability Assessment Tools</h1>
<h2>Product Based Solutions</h2>
<p>Installed in internal network. Installed on a private or non-routable space or in Internet-addressable portion of organization's network. If installed on a private network, they can't always detect outside attacks.</p>
<h2>Service Based Solutions</h2>
<p>Offered by third parties such as auditing or security consultance firms. Hosted inside or outside the network. Drawback is that attackers can audit the network from the outside.</p>
<h2>Tree Based Assessment</h2>
<p>The auditor selects different strategies for each machine or component. Relies on administrator to provide starting piece of intelligence.</p>
<h2>Inference Based Assessment</h2>
<p>Starts by building inventory of the protocols found on the machine. Scanning to detect which ports are attached to services, such as an email server, web server or database server. After finding services, it selects vulnerabilities on each machine and starts to execute only those relevant tests.</p>
<p>
  <ol>
    <ul>Locating nodes -> locate live nodes using various scanning techniques</ul>
    <ul>Performing service and OS discover on them -> enumerate open ports and services</ul>
    <ul>Testing those services and OS for known vulnerabilities</ul>
  </ol>
</p>

<h2>Types</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Host Based Vulnerabilitiy Assessment Tools -> appropriate for servers that run various applications such as the Web, critical files, databases, directories and remote access. Able to detect high levels of vulnerabilities and provide required information about patches.</ul> 
  <ul>Depth Assessment Tools -> discover and identify previously unknown vulnerabilities in a system. Tools as fuzzers are used and a set of vulnerability signatures to test the resistance</ul>
  <ul>Application layer Vulnerability Assessment Tools -> all kinds of operating systems and applications, directed towards web servers or databases</ul>
  <ul>Scope Assessment Tools </ul>
  <ul>Active and Passive Tools -> Active scanners check network functions that consume resources on the network, passive scanners do not considerably affect system resources as they only observe</ul>
  <ul>Location and Data Examination Tools -> Network based scanner interact only with the real machine where they reside, agent-based scanner reside on a single machine but can scan several machines on the same network, proxy scanner can scan networks from any machine on the network, cluster scanner can simultaneously perform two or more scans on different machines in the network </ul>
