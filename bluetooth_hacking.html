<h1>Bluetooth</h1>
<p>Bluetooth is a wireless technology that allows devices to share data over short distances. Bluetooth technology is vulnerable to various types of attacks. </p>
    <h2>Bluetooth Stack</h2>
    <p>Bluetooth is a short-range wireless communication technology that replaces cables connecting portable or fixed devices while maintaining high levels of security. 
    It allows mobile phones, computers and other devices to exchange information. Two BT enabled devices connect through a pairing technique.</p>
    <p>The BT Stack has two ports: general purpose and embedded system</p>
    <h2>BT Modes</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Discoverable -> when discoverable, BT devices are visible to other BT enabled devices; the discoverable mode is necessary only while connecting to a device for the first time. Upon 
        saving the connection, the devices remember each other; therefore the discoverable mode is not necessary for lateral connection establishment</ul>
        <ul>Limited discoverable -> in limited discoverable mode, the BT devices are discoverable only for a limited period, for a specific event or during temporary conditions; However, there is no 
        Host Controller Interface (HCI) command to set a device directly in the limited discoverable mode. A user has to do this indirectly. When a device is set to the limited discoverable mode, it 
        filters out non-matched IACs and reveals itself only to those that matched</ul>
        <ul>Non-discoverable -> setting to non-discoverable prevents that device from appearing on the list during a BT enabled device search process; However, it remains visible to users and devices 
        that were previously paired with or knows its MAC address</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <h2>Pairing Modes</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Non-pairable mode -> a BT device rejects pairing requests</ul>
        <ul>Pairable mode -> a BT device can accept pairing requests and establish a connection with a device that requested pairing</ul>
    </ol></p>
<h1>Bluetooth Hacking</h1>
<p>BT hacking refers to the exploitation of BT Stack implementation vulnerabilities to compromise sensitive data in BT enabled devices and networks.</p>
<p>BT enabled devices connect and communicate wirelessly through ad-hoc networks known as <b>piconets</b>. Attackers can gain information by hacking the target BT enabled device from another BT 
enabled device.</p>
<h2>BT attacks</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul><b>Bluesmacking</b> -> send an oversized packet to a victim's device, causing a buffer overflow (similar to ICMP ping-of-death)</ul>
    <ul><b>Bluejacking</b> -> using BT to send messages to users without the recipient's consent, similar to email spamming</ul>
    <ul><b>Bluesnarfing</b> -> method of gaining access to sensitive data in a BT enabled device; an attacker within the range of a target can use specialized software to obtain the data 
    stored on the victim's device; to perform Bluesnarfing, an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Object Exchange (OBEX) protocol that BT uses to exchange information. The attacker connects with 
    the target and performs a GET operation for files with correctly guessed or known names, such as /pb.vcf for the device's phonebook or /cal.vcs for the device's calendar file</ul>
    <ul><b>Bluesniff</b> -> POC code for a BT wardriving utility, for finding hidden and discoverable BT devices, operating on Linux</ul>
    <ul><b>Bluebugging</b> -> attack in which an attacker gains remote access to a target BT enabled device without the victim's awareness; in this attack, an attacker sniffs sensitive information 
    and might perform malicious activities such as intercepting phone calls and messages and forwarding calls and text messages</ul>
    <ul><b>BluePrinting</b> -> footprinting technique performed by an attacker to determine the make and model of a target BT enabled device. Attackers collect this information to create infographics of the 
    model, manufacturer etc. and analyze them to determine whether the device has exploitable vulnerabilities</ul>
</ol></p>
