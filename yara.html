<h1>YARA Rules</h1>
<p><a target=_blank href=https://yara.readthedocs.io>YARA</a> is a malware research tool that allows security analysts to detect and classify malware or other malicious codes through a rule-based approach.</p>
<p>YARA is also a multi-platform tool that runs on Windows, macOS en Linux. This tool allows security analysts to create "rules" or descriptions of malware families in the form of text or binary patterns.
The created rules analyze specific patterns in the file and alert security analysts if the file is harmful. The description or rule comprises a Boolean expression and strings that establish the logic behind it.</p>
<p>Security analysts can also write YARA rules for examining a private database or malicious binaries across an organization to detect intrusions. A rule is comprised of three parts:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul><b>Condition</b> -> when will the result be TRUE against a file, which can be investigated; boolean expressions that allow defining the matching or result</ul>
    <ul><b>Strings</b> -> provides meaning to the condition section by defining all the strings that need to be searched within the files; hexadecimal strings, text strings, regex</ul>
    <ul><b>Metadata</b> -> general information which can be used by a security analyst to identify the files gathered by a specific rule</ul>
</ol></p>
