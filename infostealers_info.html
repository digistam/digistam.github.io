<h1>Infostealers</h1>
  <h2>Definition infostealer</h2>
  <p>An information stealer (commonly described as an “infostealer” or a “stealer”) is a type of malware, 
    typically a Trojan malware virus, that is able to disguise itself and gather sensitive information. 
    Its ultimate purpose is to collect your information from any infected computer.</p>

<p>The term info stealer is self-explanatory. This type of malware resides in an infected computer and gathers data in order to send it to the attacker. 
  Typical targets are credentials used in online banking services, social media sites, emails, or FTP accounts.</p>
<p>Info stealers may use many methods of data acquisition. The most common are:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>hooking browsers (and sometimes other applications) and stealing credentials that are typed by the user</ul>
    <ul>using web injection scripts that are adding extra fields to web forms and submitting information from them to a server owned by the attacker
</ul>
    <ul>form grabbing (finding specific opened windows and stealing their content)</ul>
    <ul>keylogging
</ul>
    <ul>stealing passwords saved in the system and cookies</ul>
    <ul>Modern info stealers are usually parts of botnets. Sometimes the target of attack and related events are configured remotely by the command sent from the Command and Control server (C&C)</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>The age of info stealers started with the release of ZeuS in 2006. It was an advanced Trojan, targeting credentials of online banking services. 
    After the code of ZeuS leaked, many derivatives of it started appearing and popularized this type of malware. In December 2008, a social media credential stealear, Koobface, 
    was detected for the first time. It originally targeted users of popular networking websites like Facebook, Skype, Yahoo Messenger, MySpace, Twitter, and email clients such as Gmail, 
    Yahoo Mail, and AOL Mail. Nowadays, most botnet agents have some features of info stealing, even if it is not their main goal.</p>
<p>Info stealers are dangerous for all the users of an infected machine. The consequences are proportionally serious to the importance of stolen passwords. 
  Common dangers are: violated privacy, leakage of confidential information, having money stolen from an account, and being impersonated by the attacker. 
  Stolen email accounts can be northerly used to send spam, or a stolen SSH account can be used as a proxy for attacks performed by cybercriminals.</p>
  <h2>Threat actor</h2>
  <p>We tackle why infostealers are a stratospheric threat actor, one who can stealthily acquire your data through 
    sophisticated malware. By exploring how cybercriminals are leveraging and utilizing this form of malicious cyber threat, 
    you’ll understand why infostealers are so dangerous. We’ll also share what types of channels are allowing these 
    cybersecurity breaches to thrive.</p>
    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p><ol><ul>
    Passwords saved across all the browsers</ul>
      <ul>Cookies</ul>
      <ul>Computer search history</ul>
      <ul>Credit card information</ul>
      <ul>Cryptocurrency wallets</ul>
      <ul>Basis information about the computer (OS, hardware, installed software etc.)</ul>
      <ul>Login credentials</ul>
    </ol></p>
  <p>All information is collated into an archive, which is called a <b>log</b></p>
  <p>The stolen log data contains very sensitive information that enable widespread command and control. 
  It is a prime time for a malicious actor to easily take full control of your online identity, from accessing 
    your credit card to your crypto wallets– the vulnerabilities and possibilities are widespread.

Infostealers can typically access your accounts on any type of web platform, including:</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Email</ul>
  <ul>Banking</ul>
  <ul>Gaming</ul>
  <ul>Social media</ul>
  <ul>Crypto trading</ul>
  <ul>Online shopping and marketplaces</ul>
</ol></p>
  <h2>Cookie data</h2>
  <p>Online cookie data can be directly pasted in any browser for any infostealer to connect on your behalf. 
  Infostealer malware has become a popular way for cybercriminals to collaborate by spreading sensitive data 
  via dark web forums or via private communities on Telegram.</p>
  <h2>Infostealer community on dark web</h2>
  <p>Creating infostealer malware requires knowledge and skill, however, obtaining and using it does not. 
    The malware ecosystem is moving towards Malware as a Service (MaaS), and infostealers are cashing in. 
    The prices are roughly the same between the different strains of stealers. 
    They usually range between $100-200 a month or $1,000 for a lifetime subscription.</p>
    <p>For purchasers, acquiring pre-harvested data bypasses the need for initial reconnaissance and access attempts, 
    which often demand extensive resources.</p>
    <h2>Initial Access Brokers (IAB)</h2>
    <p>Initial Access Brokers are cyber threat actors who specialize in selling access to compromised networks, 
    typically to facilitate more extensive breaches leading to ransomware attacks. Beyond this, a variety of 
      cybercriminals utilize these platforms to trade stolen credentials, aiming to execute subsequent attacks.
The fact that they can be bought cheaply—it is a sure fire reason why they are so dangerous.</p>
<h2>Why are infostealers so dangerous</h2>
<p>Infostealers are ascending. So why should you be wary? While the majority of infected computers are personal 
  computers, because the distribution channels are closely linked to gaming or the illegal infiltration of accounts, 
  certain threat actors target corporate devices, usually via phishing campaigns. Companies get stung double fold by the 
  “bring your own device” to work option in corporate environments as well as the blurring of lines when employees use 
  professional devices for personal activities.</p>
  <p>Infostealers are dangerous for a myriad of reasons but the greatest risk is that they are widely available, 
    easily accessible and can be deployed by anyone as they do not require you have a high level of technical 
    skill or knowledge. This makes them far more dangerous than other cyber threats</p>
    <p><i>74% of all breaches include the human element, with people being involved either via Error, Privilege Misuse, Use of stolen credentials or
      Social Engineering.</i></p>
