<h1>Computer Worms</h1>
<p>Computer Worms are standalone malicious programs that replicate, execute and spread across network connections independently without human intervention.</p>
    <p>Worms are designed to replicate and spread across a network, consuming available computing resources and causing network servers, web servers and individual computer systems to 
    become overloaded and stop responding. Some worms carry a payload to damage the host system.</p>
    <p>Worms are a subtype of viruses. Attackers use worm payloads to install backdoors on infected computers, which turns them into zombies and creates a botnet. Attacker use these 
    botnets to initiate cyber attacks.</p>
<h2>How is a Worm different from a Virus</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>A virus infects a system by inserting itself into a file or executable program</ul>
    <ul>A worm infects a system by exploiting a vulnerability in an OS or application by replicating itself</ul>
    <ul>A virus might delete or alter the content of files or change the location of files in the system</ul>
    <ul>Typically, a worm does not modify any stored programs; it only exploits the CPU and memory</ul>
    <ul>A virus alters the way a computer system operates without knowledge of consent of a user</ul>
    <ul>A worm consumes network bandwidth, system memory etc. excessively overloading servers and computer systems</ul>
    <ul>A virus can't spread to other computers unless an infected file is replicated and sent to other computers</ul>
    <ul>A worm can replicate itself and spread using IRC, Outlook or other applicable mailing programs after installation in a system</ul>
    <ul>A virus spreads at a uniform rate, as programmed</ul>
    <ul>A worm spreads more rapidly than a virus</ul>
    <ul>Viruses are difficult to remove from infected machines</ul>
    <ul>Compared with a virus, a worm can be removed easily from a system</ul>
