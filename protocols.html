<h1>Protocols</h1>
<h2>LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution)</h2>
<p>Protocol based on Domain Name System (DNS) packet format that allows both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts to perform name resolution for hosts on the same local link.
  It is included in Windows and implemented by systemd-resolved on Linux. Port 5353</p>

<h2>NBT-NS (NetBios over TCP/IP)</h2>
  <p>NetBios over TCP/IP is an old protocol for name resolution if the DNS servers in the network cannot provide suitable names. NetBios is used in 
  Windows versions up to Windows ME. Ports 137, 138, 139</p>

<h2>MDNS (Multicast DNS)</h2>
  <p>In computer networking, the MDNS protocol resolves hostnames to IP addresses within small networks that do not include a local name server. It uses 
  essentially the same programming interfaces, packet formats and semantics as unicast Domain Name System (DNS). It was designed to work as either a 
  stand-alone protocol or compatible with standard DNS servers. It uses UDP and is implemented by Apple Bonjour and most Linux distro's. The Windows 10 
  implementation was limited to discover printers, but now resolves hostnames as well. Port 5353</p>

    <p>In order to see if any protocols are active on the subnet use <b>Bettercap</b> <i></i>net.sniff on</i>. You will see all nice goodies like:</p>

    <p>In my humble subnet, I have things goin'on like http, dns, https, mdns</p>
