<h1>Email Encryption</h1>
<p>Most businesses use email as the primary source of communication as it is simple and easy to 
  communicate or share information. Emails can contain sensitive information, in wrong hands it can 
  cause severe losses.</p>
  <h2>Digital Signature</h2>
  <p>A digital signature uses asymmetric cryptography to simulate the security properties of a 
  signature in digital form rather than in written form. A digital signature is a cryptographic 
  means of authentication. Public key cryptography uses asymmetric encryption and helps the user 
  to create a digital signature. The two types of keys in public key cryptography are the 
  private key (only the signer knows this key and uses it to create a digital signature) and the 
  public key (widely known and the relying party uses it to verify the digital signature).</p>
