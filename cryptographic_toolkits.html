<h1>Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)</h1>  
  <p>PGP is a protocol used to encrypt and decrypt data with authentication and cryptographic 
  privacy. It is often used for data compression, digital signing, encryption and decryption 
  of messages, emails, files and directories, and to enhance the privacy of email communications. 
  The alogrithm used for message encryption is RSA for key transport and IDEA for bulk-message 
  encryption. PGP uses RSA for computing digital signatures and MD5 for computing message 
  digests.</p>
  <p>It combines the best features for both conventional (around 1000 times faster than public 
  key encryption) and public key cryptography (solution to key distribution and data transmission 
  issues), and is therefore known as a hybrid cryptosystem.</p>
  <p>PGP is used for:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Encrypting a message or file prior to transmission so that only the recipient can 
    decrypt and read it</ul>
    <ul>Clear signing of the plaintext message to ensure the authenticity of the sender</ul>
    <ul>Encrypting stored computer files so that no one besides the person who encrypted them 
    can decrypt them</ul>
    <ul>Deleting files rather than just removing them from the directory or folder</ul>
    <ul>Data compression for storage or transmission</ul>
  </ol></p>
<p>How PGP works</p>
  <p>PGP Encryption</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>When a user encrypts data with PGP, PGP first compresses the data</ul>
  <ul>Compressing the data reduces patterns in the plaintext that could be exploited by 
  most cryptanalysis techniques to crack the ciper, thereby increasing the resistance to 
  cryptanalysis considerably</ul>
  <ul>PGP then creates a random key that is a one-time only secret key</ul>
  <ul>PGP uses the random key generated to encrypt the plaintext, resulting in a ciphertext</ul>
  <ul>Once the data is encrypted, a random key is encrypted with the recipient's public key</ul>
  <ul>The public key encrypted random key is sent along with the ciphertext to the recipient</ul>
</ol></p>
  <p>PGP Decryption</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Decryption works in reverse</ul>
    <ul>The recipient's copy of PGP uses his private key instead of the public key to recover
    the temporary random key</ul>
    <ul>PGP then uses the recovered random key to decrypt the conventionally encrypted ciphertext</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <p>Each step of the PGP encryption process (hashing, data compression, symmetric key cryptography, 
  and public key cryptography) uses one of the various supported algorithms.</p>

  <h1>GNU Privacy Guard (GPG)</h1>
  <p>GPG is a software replacement of PGP and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard that is used 
  to encrypt and decrypt data. GPG is also called a hybrid encryption software program, as it uses both 
  symmetric key cryptography and asymmetric cryptography for improved speed and secure key exchange, which 
  is achieved using the receiver's public key for encrypting the session key.</p>
  <p>GPG also supports S/MIME and Secure Shell (SSH). The latest version of GPG supports most cryptographic 
  functions, such as elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA, ECDH and EdDSA), and it also supports the 
  cryptography library Libgcrypt.</p>
  <p>GPG is used for:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Proper key management of both private and public keys</ul>
    <ul>Creating new private keys and exporting or importing any key even though it is in some 
    armored (eg. ASCII) format</ul>
    <ul>Pushing the public key to the key server by signing code with the GPG key having a public 
    signature</ul>
    <ul>Deleting a private key from local storage</ul>
    <ul>Encrypting and signing files using asymmetric keys for encrypting any file used for email 
    or FTP</ul>
    <ul>Decrypting and verifying the encrypted file using asymmetric keys</ul>
    <ul>Detaching signatures where the signature file can be detached from the message file </ul>
    <ul>Managing and building the web of trust</ul>
    <ul>Automatically securing messages in messaging applications such as Psi and FIre</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <p>How GPG works</p>
  <p>GPG Encryption:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>GPG encrypts messages individually by using asymmetric key pairs</ul>
    <ul>The user sends the raw file, and GPG is used for signing the file using the sender's
    private key for confirming the file contents at the time of signing</ul>
    <ul>Then, the file is encrypted using the receiver's public key. Now, the file can be 
    decrypted only with the receiver's private key</ul>
    <ul>After encrypting the data, the encrypted file can be stored locally, distributed to the 
    FTP servers, or sent to the email recipients</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <p>GPG Decryption:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>GPG decryption is the reverse process of GPG encryption</ul>
    <ul>As the asymmetric key pairs are used, GPG searches for the receiver's private key 
    for decrypting the file</ul>
    <ul>Signature verification is done automatically by the GPG using the sender's public key 
    after the decryption</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h1>Web of Trust (WOT)</h1>
  <p>WOT is a trust model of PGP, OpenPGP and GnuPG accessible systems. It is an idea of decentralizing
  the key distribution among PGP users. In the PKI, only a centralized power such as the CA signs certificates
  in the network, ensuring authenticity between the public key and its owner. In WOT, everyone in the 
  network is a CA, and they can sign for other trusted entities. WOT is a network chain in which individuals 
  intermediately validate each other's certificates using their signatures. These signatures verify the 
  ownership of keys from various trust levels. There is a bunch of similar trust levels through direct or 
  indirect references in WOT.</p>
  <p>In WOT, every PGP user in the network has a ring of public keys to encrypt the data, and they 
  introduce many others whom they trust. In this trust model, a user encodes the data with the receiver's
  public key that is decrypted only by the receiver's private key. Then, every user in the model digitally 
  signs the data with their private keys; when the recipient is validating it against the user's public key, 
  he can confirm the user's authenticity. This process will ensure that data are received from a valid 
  user without being modified, and only the intended user can access the information, as only he holds the 
  related private key.</p>

  <h1>Encrypting Email messages in Outlook</h1>
  <h2>Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Encryption</h2>
  <p>S/MIME certification is a technique that allows users to encrypt their email messages. It is used 
  for encrypting Outlook email messages so that senders and the designated receivers can access them 
  without compromising the integrity of the message.</p>

  <h1>Disk Encryption</h1>
  <p>Disk encryption encrypts every bit of data stored on a disk or a disk volume, thus preventing illegal
  access to data storage. Disk encryption is a technology that protects the confidentiality of the 
  data stored on a disk by converting it into an ureadable code using disk encryption software or hardware.</p>
  <p>BitLocker uses a microchip that is called a <b>Trusted Platform Module (TPM)</b> to provide 
  enhanced protection for your data and to preserve early boot component integrity. The TPM can help 
  protect your data from theft or unauthorized access by encrypting the entire WÃ­ndows volume.</p>
