<h1>Hacking Concepts</h1>
<h2>What is Hacking</h2>
<p>Hacking in the field of computer security refers to <b>exploiting system vulnerabilities and compromising security controls to gain unauthorized or inappropriate access to system resources</b>. Hacking 
is generally done using scripts or other network programming. Network hacking techniques include creating viruses and worms, performing DoS attacks, establishing unauthorized remote access connections to a device 
using Trojans or backdoors, creating botnets, packet sniffing, phishing and password cracking.</p>
<h2>Who is a Hacker</h2>
<p>A hacker is a person who breaks into a system or network without authorization to destroy, steal sensitive data or perform malicious attacks. A hacker is an intelligent individual with excellent computer 
skills, along with the ability to create and explore the computer's software and hardware. Classes:</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Black Hats -> illegal or malicious purposes, criminal activities, also known as crackers</ul>
  <ul>White Hats -> penetration testers, defensive purposes, permission from the system owner</ul>
  <ul>Gray Hats -> work both offensively and defensively at various times</ul>
  <ul>Suicide Hackers -> aim to bring down critical infrastructure for a "cause" and are not worried about facing jail terms or punishments, compare with suicide bombers</ul>
  <ul>Script Kiddies -> unskilled hackers who compromise systems by running scripts, tools and software developed by real hackers, focus on quantity rather than quality</ul>
  <ul>Cyber Terrorists -> individuals with a wide range of skills, motivated by religious or political beliefs, to create fear or large-scale disruption of computer networks</ul>
  <ul>State-Sponsored Hackers -> employed by the government to penetrate, gain top-secret information etc. of other governments</ul>
  <ul>Hacktivist -> activism, act of protest</ul>
  <ul>Hacker Teams -> consortium of skilled hackers having their own resources and funding</ul>
  <ul>Industrial Spies -> corporate espionage, focus on stealing blueprints, formulas, designs etc.</ul>
  <ul>Insiders -> employees (trusted persons) with access to critical assets of an organization</ul>
  <ul>Criminal Syndicates -> groups of individuals or communities involved in organized, planned and prolonged criminal activities</ul>
  <ul>Organized Hackers -> group of hackers working together in criminal activities, well organized in a hierarchical structure with leaders and workers</ul>
</ol></p>
  <h1>Ethical Hacking</h1>
  <p>An ethical hacker's evaluation of a client's information system security seeks to answer:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>What can an attacker see on the target system</ul>
    <ul>What can an intruder do with the information</ul>
    <ul>Are the attacker's attempts being noticed on the target systems</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <p>The entire process of ethical hacking and subsequent patching of discovered vulnerabilities depends on questions such as:</p>
  <p><ol><ul>What is the organization trying to protect</ul>
  <ul>Against whom or what are they trying to protect it</ul>
  <ul>Are all the components of the information system adequately protected, updated and patched</ul>
  <ul>How much time, effort and money is the client willing to invest to gain adequate protections</ul>
  <ul>Do the information security measures comply with industry and legal standards</ul>
    </ol></p>
  <h2>What is Ethical Hacking</h2>
  <p>Ethical hacking is a structured and organized security assessment, usually as part of a penetration test or security audit, and is a crucial component of risk assessment, auditing, counter fraud and 
  information systems security best practices. It is used to identify risks and highligh remedial actions. It is also used to reduce ICT costs by resolving vulnerabilities.</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Talk to the client and discuss the needs to be addressed during the testing</ul>
    <ul>Prepare and sign NDA documents with the client</ul>
    <ul>Organize a Tiger Team (ethical hacking team) and prepare the schedule for testing</ul>
    <ul>Conduct the test</ul>
    <ul>Analyze the results of the testing and prepare a report</ul>
    <ul>Present the report findings to the client</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h1>What is Risk</h1>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Probability of the occurence of a threat or an event that will damage, cause loss to, or have other negative impacts on the organization, either from internal or external liabilities</ul>
    <ul>Possibility of a threat acting upon an internal or external vulnerability and causing harm to a resource</ul>
    <ul>Product of the likelihood that an event will occur and the impact that the event might have on an information technology asset</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <p><b>RISK = Threats x Vulnerabilities x Impact</b></p>
  <h2>IT Risk</h2>
  <p><b>RISK = Threat x Vulnerability x Asset Value</b></p>
  <h2>Risk Level</h2>
  <p><b>Level of Risk = Consequence x Likelihood</b></p>
  <h2>Risk Management</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Risk Identification</ul>
    <ul>Risk Assessment</ul>
    <ul>Risk Treatment</ul>
    <ul>Risk Tracking and Review</ul>
  </ol></p>
