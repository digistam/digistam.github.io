<h1>Wireless Threats</h1>
<p>Wireless networks can be at risk to various types of attacks, including:</p> 
<p><ol><ul><b>access-control</b> attacks</ul>
    <ul><b>integrity</b> attacks</ul>
    <ul><b>confidentiality</b> attacks</ul>
    <ul><b>availability</b> attacks</ul> 
    <ul><b>authentication</b> attacks</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Access Control Attacks</h2>
<p>Wireless access-control attacks aim to penetrate a network by evading WLAN access-control measures, such as AP MAC filters and Wi-Fi port access controls.</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul><b>WarDriving</b>: WLANs detected by sending probe requests over a connection or by listening to web beacons; Tools: <a target=_blank href=https://kismac-ng.org/>KisMAC</a>, <a target=_blank href=https://www.netstumbler.com/>NetStumbler</a></ul>
    <ul><b>Rogue access points</b>: in order to create a backdoor to a trusted network, an attacker may install an unsecured AP or fake AP inside a firewall; A wireless AP is termed a <b>rogue access point</b> when it is installed on a trusted network without authorization</ul>
    <ul><b>MAC spoofing</b>: reconfigure a MAC address to appear as an authorized AP to a host on a trusted network; Tools: <a target=_blank href=https://smac-tool.com/>SMAC</a></ul>
    <ul><b>AP misconfiguration</b></ul>
    <ul><b>Ad hoc associations</b>: using any USB adapter or wireless card; connecting host to an unsecured client to attack a specific client or to avoid AP security</ul>
    <ul><b>Promiscuous client</b>: using an promiscuous client, an attacker exploits the behavior of 802.11 wireless cards as they always attempt to find a stronger signal signal to connect; Intent to lure the client to connect to 
    the attacker's AP</ul>
    <ul><b>Client mis-association</b>: client may intentionally of accidentally connect or associate with an AP outside the legitimate network because the WLAN signals travel through the air, walls and other obstructs</ul>
    <ul><b>Unauthorized association</b></ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Integrity Attacks</h2>
<p>An integrity attack involves changing or altering data during transmission. In wireless integrity attacks, attackers send forged control, management or data frames over a wireless network to misdirect wireless
devices and perform another type of attack such as a DoS attack.</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul><b>Data-Frame injection</b>: constructing and sending forged 802.11 frames; Tools: <a target=_blank href=https://airpwn.sourceforge.net/Airpwn.html>Airpwn</a>,
