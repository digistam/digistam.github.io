<h1>Steganography</h1>

<h2>classification</h2>
<ol><ul>Technical</ul>
  <ul>Linguistic</ul>
</ol>
<p>In <b>technical steganography</b>, a message is hidden using scientific methods (invisible ink, microdots, hand stamping a the club, computer based methods)</p>
<p><b>Computer-Based Methods (technical steganography)</b></p>
Six groups:<br/>
<ol>
  <ul>Substitution Techniques: secret information is encoded by substituting insignificant bits with the secret information</ul>
  <ul>Transform Domain Techniques: information is hidden in significant parts of the cover image (using image procession like cropping, compression etc.)</ul>
  <ul>Spread Spectrum Techniques: using specific bandwith in communication signals </ul>
  <ul>Statistical Techniques</ul>
  <ul>Distortion Techniques</ul>
  <ul>Cover Generation Techniques</ul>
</ol></p>
  <p>In <b>linguistic steganography</b>, a message is hidden in the <b>carrier</b> of another file.</p>
<p>A <b>carrier</b> is the medium used to communicate or transfer messages or files and comprises<br/>
- hidden message<br/>
- carrier<br/>
- steganography key</p>
<h2>Linguistic Steganography</h2>
<p>Classification:<br/>
- Semagrams<br/>
- Open Codes</p>
<p><b>Semagrams</b> involve a technique that hides information with the help of signs or symbos. The user embeds some objects or symbols in the data to change the appearance of the data to a predetermined meaning.<br/>
Visual Semagrams: information hidden in drawing, painting, letter, music or a symbol<br/>
Text Semagrams: a text semagram hides the text message by converting or transforming the appearance of the carrier text message, such as by changing font sizes and styles, adding extra spaces as whitespaces in the document and including flourishes in letters or handwritten text.</p>
<p><b>Open Codes</b> hide the secret message in a legitimate carrier message specifically designed in a pattern on a document that is unclear to the average reader. The carrier message functions as <b>overt</b> communication and the secret message as the <b>covert</b> communication.</p>
<p>Two groups:<br/>
- Jargon Codes: a certain language is used that is understood only by a particular group of people while meaningless for others. A cue is a word that appears in the text and then transports the message.<br/>
- Covered Ciphers: this technique hides the message in a carrier medium visible to everyone and can be extracted by any person with knowledge of the message used to hide it. Further classification of cover ciphers includes<br/> 
  - null ciphers: message is hidden in a large amount of useless data<br/>
  - grille ciphers: encrypt plaintext by writing it onto a sheet of paper through a pierced cardboard etc. One can decipher the message using an identical grille</p>
<h2>Types based on cover medium</h2>
<p>Basic steganography can be broken down into two areas:<br/>
- data hiding<br/>
- document making: protection against removal</p>
<oL>
  <ul><b>Image Steganography</b>: conceal message within an image by exploiting the redundant bits with very little effect when altered</ul>
  <ul><b>Document Steganography</b></ul>
  <ul><b>Folder Steganography</b></ul>
  <ul><b>Video Steganography</b></ul>
  <ul><b>Audio Steganography</b></ul>
  <ul><b>Whitespace Steganography</b>: conceal messages in ASCII by adding whitespaces to the ends of the lines (Snow tool)</ul>
  <ul><b>Web Steganography</b></ul>
  <ul><b>Spam/Email Steganography</b></ul>
  <ul><b>DVD-Rom Steganography</b></ul>
  <ul><b>Natural Steganography</b></ul>
  <ul><b>Hidden OS Steganography</b></ul>
  <ul><b>C++ Source-Code Steganography</b></ul>
</oL>
<p><b>Image Steganography</b> is classified into two types:<br/>
- Image domain: the message is directly embedded in the intensity of the pixels<br/>
- Transform domain: transformation of image first, then the message is embedded in the image</p>
<p><b>Image File Steganography Techniques</b>
<ol><ul>Least-Significant-Bit Insertion: LSB is the most commonly used technique of image steganography</ul>
<ul>Masking and Filtering: exploits the limitations of human vision which is incapable of detecting slight changes in images</ul>
<ul>Algorithms and Transformation: hiding secret information during image compression (mathematical function)</ul></ol></p>
  <p><b>Least-Significant-Bit insertion technique</b>: the rightmost bit of each pixel of an image hold secret data<br/>
  0001 010<b>1</b> 0101 110<b>0</b> 0100 110<b>0</b> 1101 100<b>1</b> etc.</p>
  <h2>Tools</h2>
  <p>OpenStego</p>
  <p><a target=_top href=https://www.openstego.com>OpenStego</a>a is a free steganography tools with two main functionalities: data hiding within a cover file and watermarking files with an invisible signature to detect unauthorized file copying.</p>
