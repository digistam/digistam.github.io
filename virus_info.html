<h1>Virus and worm concepts</h1>
<h2>Viruses</h2>
<p>Computer viruses have the potential to wreak havoc on both business and personal computers. The lifetime of a virus depends 
on the ability to reproduce itself. Therefore, attackers design every virus code such that the virus <b>replicates itself</b> 
    n times.</p>
<p>A computer virus is self-replicating and produces its code by attaching copies of itself to other executable code and
operates without knowledge of consent of the user. Like biological virus, a computer virus is contagious and can contaminate 
other files; however infection of external machines is only possible with the assistance of computer users.</p>
    <p>Some viruses affect computers as soon as their code is executed; other viruses remain dormant until a pre-determined 
    logical circumstance is met. Viruses infect a variety of files, such as overlay files (.ovl) and executable files 
    (.exe, .sys, .com or .bat). Viruses are transmitted through file downloads, infected disks/flash drives and email 
    attachments.</p>
