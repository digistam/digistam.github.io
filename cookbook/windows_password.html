<h1>Bypass Windows 11 password</h1>
<p>A Windows 11 laptop had an unknown logon password. It was very easy to bypass it.</p>

<h2>Ventoy bootable USB</h2>
<p>Download <a target=_blank href=https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html>Ventoy</a> and use it to create a bootable USB flash drive</p>
<h2>WinByePass</h2>
<p>Download the <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/TinToSer/winbyepass?tab=readme-ov-file>WinByePass</a> ISO file and copy it to the Ventoy USB flash drive.</p>

<p>Put the USB flash drive in the computer and boot the system (just google for your hardware device about shortcut, F8, F10, F12 etc.). After booting you will see Windows is starting and then 
it will reboot again.</p>
<h2>On screen keyboard</h2>
<p>After the computer has booted and Windows is visible again, you have to use the On screen keyboard. When starting the On screen keyboard, a Command window opens with the highest privilege
  level (NT Authority\SYSTEM). You can do anything with the system now.
  <h2>Usernames</h2>
  <p>To see usernames, type:</p>
<p><i>net user</i></p>
<h2>Set passwords</h2>
<p>To set a new password:</p>
<p><i>net user username 1234</i></p>
<p>Here, username is the targetted username and 1234 is the new password. Press enter and you will see "Completed succesfully". Close the Command window and login with the new password.</p>
<h2>Remove backdoor</h2>
<p>After your job is done then either Microsoft Windows will automatically remove the backdooring by deleting the registry key we modified or you can also do it by running the below command in CMD as an Admin. 
  But before that make sure if the registry key is already removed by Microsoft. See whether "On screen keyboard" opens instead of the Command window. If the Command window opens then it means Microsoft has 
  not removed the registry on its own.</p>
<p><i>reg delete "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution options\osk.exe" /f > nul</i></p>
