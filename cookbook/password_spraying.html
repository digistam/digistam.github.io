<h1>Password spraying with CrackMapExec</h1>
<p>from the Nmap results we can observe that other hosts in the subnet are running services such as RDP, SSH, and FTP. 
  Therefore, we can perform password spraying on each service individually to check for correct credentials. In this task, we will be focusing on RDP. 
  However, you can explore and check other services.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Download and install <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec>CrackMapExec</a></ul>
  <ul>Execute crackmapexec rdp 10.10.1.0/24 -u users.txt -p “cupcake”</ul>
  <ul>users.txt contains a list of usernames / accounts (example: admin)</ul>
  <ul>CME will show the accounts that use the password cupcake for RDP</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>CrackMapExec can be used for ftp, smb, ldap, rdp, ftp, winrm, mssql</p>
<p>Using smb it's possible to find the login credentials for Windows!</p>

<h2>Passwords from file</h2>
<p>crackmapexec smb 10.10.1.0/24 -u users.txt -p passwords.txt --continue-on-success</p>
<p>crackmapexec smb 10.10.1.0/24 -u users.txt -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --continue-on-success</p>

<h1>Brute-force attack using Hydra</h1>
<p><a target=_blank href=https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra>THC Hydra</a> is an open source, password brute-forcing tool designed around flexibility and high performance in online brute-force attacks.</p>
<p>hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt 192.168.2.0/24 smb</p>
<p>hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt 192.168.2.0/24 smb</p>
<p>Hydra can be used to not only brute force against commonly used network protocols, such as SSH, FTP and RDP, but also to conduct brute-force attacks against web applications. </p>
<p>hydra -L users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt localhost http-get</p>
<p>Hydra supports:</p>

<h1>Ncrack: Lightning-fast credential testing</h1>
<p>Ncrack is a high-speed network authentication cracking tool. It was built to help companies secure their networks by proactively testing all their hosts and networking devices for poor passwords. 
 Security professionals also rely on Ncrack when auditing their clients. Ncrack was designed using a modular approach, a command-line syntax similar to Nmap and a dynamic engine that can adapt its 
 behaviour based on network feedback. It allows for rapid, yet reliable large-scale auditing of multiple hosts. Ncrack's features include a very flexible interface granting the user full control of 
 network operations, allowing for very sophisticated bruteforcing attacks, timing templates for ease of use, runtime interaction similar to Nmap's and many more. Protocols supported include:</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>SSH</ul>
  <ul>RDP</ul>
   <ul>FTP</ul>
    <ul>Telnet</ul>
     <ul>HTTP(S)</ul>
      <ul>Wordpress</ul>
       <ul>POP3(S)</ul>
        <ul>IMAP</ul>
         <ul>CVS</ul>
          <ul>SMB</ul>
           <ul>VNC</ul>
            <ul>SIP</ul>
             <ul>Redis</ul>
              <ul>PostgreSQL</ul>
               <ul>MQTT</ul>
                <ul>MySQL</ul>
                 <ul>MSSQL</ul>
                  <ul>MongoDB</ul>
                   <ul>Cassandra</ul>
                    <ul>WinRM</ul>
                     <ul>OWA</ul>
                      <ul>DICOM</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>ncrack -vv -p 22 --user root -P 500-worst-passwords.txt 10.10.10.10</p>
<h2>Basic Attack</h2>
<p>We have defined this attack as basic because at this phase we only know that port 21 is enabled for FTP service on the victim’s machine. So with the help of the following command, 
 we will try to find out possible FTP login credential.</p>
<p>ncrack ftp://192.168.0.105</p>
<p>On executing the above command it will try to crack the password for anonymous login account</p>
<h2>Dictionary Attack</h2>
<p>Suppose you are willing to obtain correct login credential for any account such FTP, SSH or HTTP when you having following situations:</p>
<p><ol><ul>Situation 1 - Know the only username but don’t know the password</ul>
<ul>Situation 2 - Don’t know username but know the password</ul>
<ul>Situation 3- Neither have username nor the password</ul></ol></p>
<p>In such a situation, you should use a wordlist dictionary and then go with ncrack command respectively:</p>
<p><ol><ul>ncrack -user msfadmin -P pass.txt 192.168.0.105:21</ul>
<ul>ncrack -U user.txt -pass msfadmin 192.168.0.105:21</ul>
<ul>ncrack -U user.txt -P pass.txt 192.168.0.105:21</ul></ol></p>
<h2>Brute Force Attack</h2>
<p>Now, whenever you consider yourself in the following situations:</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>Situation 1 - Close assumption of few usernames and passwords for any host:service and don’t want to use a dictionary then you can go with the following command, this will reduce our effort of guessing truthful credential:</ul>
<ul>ncrack -user msfadmin,ignite -pass msfadmin,123 ftp://192.168.0.106</ul>
 <ul>Situtation2- Close assumption of usernames and passwords but there multiple hosts in a network and guessing valid login for destination machine is much time taken process</ul>
 <ul>Again with the help of ncrack following command you will be able to crack valid login for any host present in the network:</ul>
 <ul>ncrack -user msfadmin,ignite -pass msfadmin,123 192.168.0.1/24:21</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Pairwise Attack</h2>
<p>choose usernames and passwords in the pair</p>
<p>If you are not giving any dictionary, then ncrack will go with its default dictionary for pairing password for anonymous login</p>
<p><ol><ul>ncrack -v --pairwise 192.168.0.105:21</ul></ol></p>
<h2>Resume the Attack</h2>
<p>This is probably the feature that takes the cake. We all know how frustrating the loss of connection or any other technical interruption can be during testing, this is where Ncrack is the blessing. 
 If your attack gets interrupted, you can pick it right up from where you were.</p>
