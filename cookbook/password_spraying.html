<h1>Password spraying with CrackMapExec</h1>
<p>from the Nmap results we can observe that other hosts in the subnet are running services such as RDP, SSH, and FTP. 
  Therefore, we can perform password spraying on each service individually to check for correct credentials. In this task, we will be focusing on RDP. 
  However, you can explore and check other services.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Download and install <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec>CrackMapExec</a></ul>
  <ul>Execute crackmapexec rdp 10.10.1.0/24 -u users.txt -p “cupcake”</ul>
  <ul>users.txt contains a list of usernames / accounts (example: admin)</ul>
  <ul>CME will show the accounts that use the password cupcake for RDP</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>CrackMapExec can be used for ftp, smb, ldap, rdp, ftp, winrm, mssql</p>
<p>Using smb it's possible to find the login credentials for Windows!</p>
