  <h1>Remote Shell Workflow</h1>
<p>Visit <a target=_blank href=https://www.revshells.com/>On-line Reverse Shell Generator</a></p>
<p>Under IP & Port enter the Listener IP (Kali machine) and Listener port 4444.</p>
<h2>MSFvenom</h2>
<p>First, we will create payload using msfvenom option present in the reverse shell generator tool, to do so, click MSFVenom tab. You can observe, msfvenom 
  command which you can use to generate a payload (here, reverse.exe). Here, we are selecting Windows Meterpreter Staged Reverse TCP (x64) from MSFVenom 
  section to generate payload.</p>
<p>Switch to the terminal window and paste the copied code in the terminal and press Enter, to create a payload named reverse.exe</p>
<p>We will start a listener using Reverse Shell Generator, to do so, switch to the browser window and select msfconsole as Type from the drop-down under Listener.
  A code will be generated with the selected IP address and port number, click Copy to copy the code.</p>
<p>Now, switch to the terminal window and paste the copied code to start the listener. As we have started the listener, we will now, transfer the payload to the victim machine.</p>
<p>As soon as the victim starts reverse.exe, a remote shell will be created. But, in practice, it will be blocked by Windows defender or other anti-malware programs.</p>
<p>Red teamers never build quick exploits from scratch, because a lot of obfuscation, packing and encoding is needed to evade (signature based) anti-virus programs.</p>
<p>So, this cookbook recipe will soon be expanded with working examples of obfuscation, packing etc.</p>
  
<h2>PowerShell</h2>
<p>Now, we will gain access to the remote system using PowerShell script. To do so, switch to the browser window and select HoaxShell tab. In the HoaxShell section, 
  select PowerShell IEX from the left pane (change the port number to 444 in the payload) and click on Copy button at the bottom to copy the payload.</p>
  <p>Open a new terminal window as a superuser and run nano shell.ps1 command to open a text editor window. In the shell.ps1 text editor window, paste the copied 
    code Save the file and close the text editor window.</p>
    <p>We will now run a hoaxshell listener, to do so, switch to the Firefox browser and ensure the port number is 444, select hoaxshell from the Type drop-down under Listener section and click on Copy to copy the code.</p>
    <p>Switch to the terminal window and paste the copied code to start the listener.</p>
    <p>Also, here are a lot of issues, for example the script will be recognized by anti-malware programs, powershell not able to run scripts and missing Python modules in Kali./p>
