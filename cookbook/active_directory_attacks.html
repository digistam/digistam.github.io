<h1>Active Directory (AD) attacks</h1>
<p>AD attacks involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the AD to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, and steal sensitive data. 
  Techniques include password cracking, Kerberos attacks, and exploiting misconfigurations. As ethical hackers, you can use these methods 
  to test defenses, identify weaknesses, and enhance security for organizations' network infrastructures.</p>
<h2>Initial Scans to Obtain Domain Controller IP and Domain Name</h2>
<p>nmap 10.10.1.0/24</p>
<p>Observe the nmap output carefully. Here, nmap shows that host 10.10.1.22 has port 88/TCP kerberos-sec and port 389/TCP LDAP opened which confirms that 
  our DC IP address is 10.10.1.22.</p>
<p>Now, we will scan 10.10.1.22 in more detail to obtain more information. Execute the nmap -A -sC -sV 10.10.1.22 command. After scanning is complete, we 
get the Domain name. Now, we have DC IP and domain name, which can be used in the AS-REP Roasting attack.</p>
<h2>AS-REP Roasting Attack</h2>
<p>An AS-REP roasting attack targets user accounts in AD that do <b>not require Kerberos pre-authentication</b>, exploiting the DONT_REQ_PREAUTH setting. 
  Attackers can request a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) for these accounts without needing the user's password. The DC responds with an encrypted TGT, 
  which the attacker captures. This TGT, encrypted with the user's password hash, is then subjected to offline password-cracking tools such as Hashcat or John the Ripper. 
  By rapidly guessing the password, the attacker can eventually decrypt the TGT, revealing the user's password.</p>
<p>Software needed: <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/fortra/impacket>Impacket</a>. Impacket is a collection of Python scripts that an attacker can use to target Windows network protocols.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>cd impacket/examples/</ul>
  <ul>python3 GetNPUsers.py [Domain name] -no-pass -usersfile /root/ADtools/users.txt -dc-ip 10.10.1.22</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>We can observe users who have DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH set. As these users are vulnerable to AS-REP roasting, we can obtain their passwords.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>copy the hash</ul>
  <ul>echo '[hash]' > username_hash.txt</ul>
  <ul>john --wordlist ../rockyou.txt username_hash.txt</ul>
  <ul>the password in plain text will hopefully be found</ul>
</ol></p>
