  <h1>Wireshark remote sniffing</h1>
<p>
Wireshark is a network packet analyzer used to capture network packets and display packet data in detail. The tool uses Winpcap to capture packets on its own supported networks. 
  It captures live network traffic from Ethernet, IEEE 802.11, PPP/HDLC, ATM, Bluetooth, USB, Token Ring, Frame Relay, and FDDI networks. The captured files can be programmatically edited via the command-line. 
  A set of filters for customized data displays can be refined using a display filter. Here, we will use the Wireshark tool to perform password sniffing.</p>

<h2>HTTP POST</h2>
<p>
  In the "apply a display filter" field, type http.request.method == POST to filter only http POST traffic packets
</p>


<p><ol>
  <ul>Navigate to Edit -> Find Packet from the menu bar</ul>
  <ul>Click Display filter, select String from the dropdown options, click Narrow & Wide and select Narrow (UTF-8 / ASCII) </ul>
  <ul>Click Packet list, select Packet details from the dropdown options</ul>
  <ul>In the field next to String, type pwd and click the Find button</ul>
  <ul>Expand the HTML Form URL Encoded: application/x-www-form-urlencoded node</ul>
</ol>

<h2>Remote Interfaces</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Click Capture in the menu bar -> Options</ul>
  <ul>In the popup screen, click Manage Interfaces</ul>
  <ul>The Manage Interfaces window appears</ul>
  <ul>Click the Remote Interfaces tab</ul>
  <ul>Click + to add a remote host and its interface</ul>
  <ul>The Remote Interface window appears</ul>
  <ul>In the Host text field, enter the IP address of the target machine</ul>
  <ul>In the Port field, enter the port number as 2002</ul>
  <ul>Under the Authentication section, select the Password authentication radio button and enter the target machine's user credentials</ul>
  <ul>A new remote interface is added to the Manage Interfaces window, click OK</ul>
  <ul>The newly added remote interface appears in the Wireshark Capture Options window, click Start</ul>
</ol>
</p>
<p>In real-time, when attackers gain the credentials of a victim's machine, they attempt to capture its remote interface and monitor the traffic its user browses to reveal confidential user information</p>

<h2>Prepare victims computer</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Start remote desktop connection to victim's computer</ul>
  <ul>Start Control Panel on the remote computer</ul>
  <ul>Navigate to System and Security -> Windows Tools</ul>
  <ul>In the Windows Tools control panel, double click Services</ul>
  <ul>In the Services window, choose Remote Packet Capture Protocol v.0 (experimental)</ul>
  <ul>Click Start</ul>
</ol></p>
