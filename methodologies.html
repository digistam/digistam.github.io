<h1>Hacking Methodologies</h1>
<p>Learning hacking methodologies help understand the phases involved in hacking attempts along with the tactics, techniques and procedures used by real hackers.</p>

  <ul>Phase 1: Reconnaissance -> probe for weak points</ul>
  <ul>Phase 2: Weaponization -> create deliverable malicious payload using exploit and backdoor</ul>
  <ul>Phase 3: Delivery -> send weaponized bundle to victim using e-mail, USB etc.</ul>
  <ul>Phase 4: Exploitation -> exploit vulnerable by executing code on the victim's system</ul>
  <ul>Phase 5: Installation -> install malware on the system</ul>
  <ul>Phase 6: Command and Control -> create C2 channel to communicate and pass data back and forth</ul>
  <ul>Phase 7: Actions on Objectives -> perform actions to achieve goals</ul>

  <h1>Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)</h1>
  <p>TTPs enable the organizations to stop attacks at the initial stage, thereby protecting the network against massive damages.</p>
  <h2>Tactics</h2>
  <p>Tactics describe the way the threat actor operates during different phases of an attack. It consists of the various tactics used to gather information for the initial exploitaton, perform privilege escalation 
  and lateral movement, and deploy measures for persistence access to the system. Generally, APT groups <b>depend on a certain set of unchanging tactics</b> but in some cases, they adapt to differenct circumstances 
  and alter the way they perform their attacks. Therefore, the difficulty of detecting and attributing the attack campaign depends on the tactics used to perform the attack. An organization can profile threat actors 
  based on tactics they use; this consists of the way they gather information about a target, the methods they follow for initial compromise and the number of entry points they use while attempting to enter the
  target network.</p>
  <h2>Techniques</h2>
  <p>To launch an attack successfully, threat actors use several techniques during its execution. These techniques include initial exploitation, setting up and maintaining command and control channels, accessing 
  the target infrastructure and covering the tracks of data exfiltration. The techniques followed by the threat actor to conduct an attack might vary, but they are mostly similar and can be used for profiling. 
  Understanding the techniques used in the different phases of an attack is essential to analyzing the threat groups effectively.</p>
  <h2>Procedures</h2>
  <p>Procedures involve a sequence of actions performed by the threat actors to execute different steps of an attack life cycle. The number of actions usually differs depending upon the objectives of the procedure 
  and the APT group. An advanced threat actor uses advanced procedures that consists of more actions than a normal procedure to achieve the same intermediate result. An understanding and proper analysis of the 
  procedured followed by certain threat actors during an attack helps organizations profile threat actors.</p>

  <h1>Adversary Behavioral Identification</h1>
  <p>Adversary behavioral identification involves the identification of the common methods or techniques followed by an adversary to launch attacks to penetrate an organization's network. It gives insight into 
  upcoming threats and exploits. It helps to plan network security infrastructure and adapt a range of security procedures as prevention against various cyberattacks.</p>
