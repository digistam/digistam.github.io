<h1>System Operation Cost Calculation</h1>
<p>Based on the following data,  you need to calculate the approximate cost of recovery of the system operion per year</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>The cost of a new hard drive is $ 300</ul>
  <ul>The chance of hard drive failure is 1/3</ul>
  <ul>The recovery specialist earns $ 10 / hour</ul>
  <ul>Restore the OS and software to the new hard disk is 10 hours</ul>
  <ul>Restore the database from the last backup to the new hard disk is 4 hours</ul>
  <ul>Assume the EF = 1 (100%)</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Explanation</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul><b>AV (Asset Value)</b> = $300 + (14 * $10) = $440 - This represents the total cost to replace a single asset, including the price of a new hard drive and the recovery specialist's time. The recover
  process involves 10 hours for restoring the OS and software and 4 hours for restoring the database, multiplied by the recovery specialist's hourly rate</ul>
  <ul><b>SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)</b> = AV * EF (Exposure Factor) = $440 * 1 = $440 - This is the expected loss for a single event, which is the asset value multiplied by the exposure factor (EF), 
  assumed to be 100%</ul>
  <ul><b>ARO (Annual Rate of Occurence)</b> = 1/3 - This means the probability of the event occurring in one year is 1/3, based on the fact that it happens once every three years</ul>
  <ul><b>ALE (Annual Loss Expectancy)</b> = SLE * ARO = 0.33 * $440 = $145.2 - This represents the expected annual loss, calculated by multiplying the single loss expectancy by the annual rate of 
  occurence</ul>
</ol></p>
