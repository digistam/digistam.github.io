<h1>Hacking IOT</h1>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from the convergence of wireless technology, micro-electromechanical systems, micro-services and the internet. IoT solutions are applied in different sectors of 
industry, including healthcare, building management, agriculture, energy and transport. IoT devices such as wearables, industrial appliances, connected electronic devices, smart grids and smart vehicles, are
becoming part of interconnected networks. These devices generate a huge amount of data that is collected, analyzed, logged and stored on the networks.</p>

<h1>What is the IoT</h1>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT), aka Internet of Everything (IoE) refers to computer devices that are web-enabled and have the capability of sensing, collecting and sending data using sensors, and the 
communication hardware and processors that are embedded within the device. In the IoT, a <b>thing</b> refers to a device that is implanted in a natural, human-made or machine-made object and has the functionality 
of communicating over a network (<i>een device dat is geïmplanteerd in een natuurlijk, door mensen gemaakt of door machines gemaakt object dat de functionaliteit heeft om te communiceren via een netwerk</i>).</p>
<p>IoT utilizes emerging technology for sensing, networking and robotics, therefore allowing the user to achieve deeper analysis, automation and integration within a system.</p>
<h2>How the IoT works</h2>
<p>IoT technology includes four primary systems: IoT devices, gateway systems, data storage systems using cloud technology and remote control using mobile apps. These systems together make communication between 
to endpoints possible. Important components of IoT technology that play an essential role in the function of a IoT device:</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Sensing Technology (temperature, gass, location, health data etc.)</ul>
  <ul>IoT Gateways (gateways bridge the gap between an IoT device (internal network) and the end-user (external network), allowing them to communicate with each other; data collected by the sensors in the IoT device 
  is sent to the connected user of cloud through the gateway)</ul>
  <ul>Cloud Server / Data Storage (storage of data; analysis of data and sending to end-user)</ul>
  <ul>Remote control using Mobile app (end-user uses remote controls such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops etc. installed with a mobile app to monitor, control, retrieve data and take a specific action on IoT
  devices from a remote location)</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Example: a smart security system installed in a home will be integrated with a <b>gateway</b>, which in turn helps to connect the device to the internet and the cloud infrastructure. The connection with the 
cloud server is established through web services. The user on the other side, who has the required app to access the device remotely on his phone, interacts with it, which in turn allows him to interact with the 
device at home. Before accessing the device, he is asked to authenticate himself. If the credentials submitted by him match those saved in the cloud, he is granted access. The cloud server identifies the 
device's ID and sends a request associated with that device using gateways. If the smart security system senses any unusual activity, then sends an alert to the cloud through the gateway, which matches the 
device's ID and the user associated with it, and the end-user receives an alert.</p>

    <h1>IoT architecture</h1>
    <p>The IoT architecture includes several layers, from the application layer at the top to the edge technology layer at the bottom. These layers are designed in such a way that they can meet the requirements 
    of various sectors, including societies, industry, enterprises, governments etc.</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul><b>Edge Technology Layer</b> -> all the hardware components, incl. sensors, RFID tags, readers, soft sensors, devices -> <b>collecting</b> and <b>connecting devices</b></ul>
        <ul><b>Access Gateway Layer</b> -> bridge gaps between endpoints such as device and client -> <b>data handling</b>, <b>message routing</b>, <b>message identification</b> and <b>subscribing</b></ul>
        <ul><b>Internet Layer</b> -> main component in carrying out communication between endpoints</ul>
        <ul><b>Middleware Layer</b> -> operates in two-way mode, sits in the middle of application layer and hardware layer (interface) -> <b>data management</b>, <b>device management</b>, <b>data analysis</b>, 
        <b>device information discovery</b>, <b>access control</b></ul>

        <ul>DNS rebinding attack -> obtaining access to a router using malicious javascript code injected on web page</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>Hacking IoT devices: general scenario</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>An eavesdropper intercepts communication between two endpoints and discovers the confidential information that is sent across</ul>
        <ul>A fake server can be used to send unwanted commands to trigger unplanned events</ul>
        <ul>A fake device can inject a malicious script into the system to make it work as instructed by the device</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>DDoS attack</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Attacker gains remote access to vulnerable devices</ul>
        <ul>After gaining access he injects malware into the IoT devices to turn them into botnets</ul>
        <ul>Attacker uses C&C to instruct botnets and send multiple requests to target server</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>Exploit HVAC</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Attacker uses Shodan and searches for vulnerable industrial control systems (ICSs)</ul>
        <ul>The attacker then searches for default user credentials using online tools such as https://www.defpass.com</ul>
        <ul>Attacker uses default user credentials to attempt to access the ICS</ul>
        <ul>After gaining access to the ICS, the attacker attempts to gain access to the HVAC systems</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>Rolling code attack</h2>
    <p>Most smart vehicles use smart locking systems, which include an RF signal transmitted in the form of code from a modern key fob to lock or unlock the vehicle. The code sent to the vehicle is only used 
    once and is different for every other use. If a vehicle receives the same code again, it rejects it. The code that locks or unlocks a car or garage is called a <b>rolling code</b> or hopping code. It is 
    used in a keyless entry system to prevent replay attacks. An eavesdropper can capture the code transmitted and later use it to unlock the garage or vehicle. The attack is performed using a jamming device 
    that simulteneously jams the signal and sniffs the code. The attacker later uses the captured code to unlock the vehicle. Attackers use <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/exploitagency/rfcat-rolljam>RFcat-rolljam</a>
    and <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/cclabsInc/RFCrack>RFCrack</a> to perform the attack.</p>

    <h2>BlueBorne Attack</h2>
    <p>BlueBorne is a collection of various techniques based on the known vulnerabilities of the BT protocol. In all operating systems, the BT process has high privileges. After gaining access to one device, 
    an attacker can penetrate any corporate network using that device to steal critical information from the organization and spread malware to nearby devices. BlueBorne is compatible with all software versions and 
    does not require any user interaction, precondition or configuration except for BT being active. This attack establishes a connection with the target BT enabled device without even pairing with the device. 
    Using this attack, an attacker can discover BT enabled devices even though they are not in an active discovery mode. Once the attacker identifies any nearby device, he tries to extract the MAC address 
    and OS information to perform further exploitation on the target OS. Based on the vulnerabilities present in the BT protocol, attackers can even perform remote code execution and MITM attacks on the target device.</p>

    <p><ol>
        <ul>Attacker discovers active BT enabled devices around him</ul>
        <ul>he obtains the MAC address of the device</ul>
        <ul>he sends continuous probes to the target device to determine the OS</ul>
        <ul>after identifying the OS, the attacker exploits the vulnerabilities in the BT protocol to gain access to the device</ul>
        <ul>now, the attacker can perform remote code execution or a MITM attack and take full control of the device</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>Identifying and accessing local IoT devices</h2>
    <p>An attacker gains access over local IoT devices when a user from the network visits a malicious page, i.e. created and distributed by an attacker in the form of an advertisement or any attractive means. 
    Once the victim visits the harmful website, a malicious JavaScript node inside the page begins the process. In general an attacker implements two methods:</p>
    <h2>Discovering or Identifying the local IoT devices</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Attacker obtains local IP address (using malicious code)</ul>
        <ul>Attacker requests all the available devices in the network</ul>
        <ul>Active devices respond with reset packet and request for inactive devices would return timeout</ul>
        <ul>Attacker detects all available devices based on their responses</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <h2>Accessing the local IoT devices using DNS rebinding</h2>
    <p>DNS rebinding is a process of gaining access over the victim's router using a malicious javascript code injected on a web page. After this, an attacker can assault any device using the default password. 
    After identifying all the connected devices and their information in the network, the attacker exploits further to gain complete access to the local interconnected devices. Now that the attacker has the 
    information on IoT devices in the network, he follows the following steps:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Checks if the malicious code is performing DNS rebinding in all discovered devices, using DNS rebinding tools such as <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/LinkedInAttic/jaqen>Jaqen</a></ul>
        <ul>Once the DNS rebinding is successfully implemented, the attacker can command and control the local IoT devices</ul>
        <ul>The attacker can further extract private information, such as the UIDs and BSSIDs of local access points that are useful in finding the geolocation of the target devices</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>After successfully launching this attack, the attacker could bypass the security and gain access to applications running on the local IoT devices. Further, the attacker can launch random audio or 
    video files on different browsers of the devices</p>

    <h2>Fault Injection Attacks</h2>
    <p>Fault injection attacks are also known as pertubation attacks, they occur when a perpetrator injects a faulty or malicious program into a system to compromise the system security.</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Optical, Electromagnetic Fault Injection (EMFI), Body Bias Injection (BBI) -> lasers and electromagnetic pulses</ul>
        <ul>Power / Clock / Reset glitching</ul>
        <ul>Frequency / voltage tampering</ul>
        <ul>Temperature attacks</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h1>IoT hacking methodology</h1>
    <p>The following are the different phases in hacking an IoT device:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Information Gathering</ul>
        <ul>Vulnerability Gathering</ul>
        <ul>Launch Attacks</ul>
        <ul>Gain Remote Access</ul>
        <ul>Maintain Access</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <h2>Information Gathering</h2>
    <p>First step is to extract information such as the IP address, protocols (ZigBee, Z-Wave, BLE, 5G etc.), open ports, device type, geolocation, manufacturing number, manufacturing company etc.</p>
    <h2>Shodan.io</h2>
    <p><b>Shodan</b> is a search engine that provides information about all internet-connected devices such as routers, traffic lights, CCTV cameras etc. Attackers can make use of this tool to gather information 
    such as the IP address, hostname, ISP, device location and banner of the target IoT device.</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Search for webcams using geolocation -> webcamxp country:"US"</ul>
        <ul>Search using city -> webcamxp city:"streetsboro"</ul>
        <ul>using longitude and latitude -> geo:"-50.81,201,80"</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>Additional filters used by the attackers to obtain target information:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Net (IP address or CIDR)</ul>
        <ul>OS (operating system used by devices)</ul>
        <ul>Port (find all open ports)</ul>
        <ul>Before/after (provides results within a certain timeframe)</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>Information Gathering using MultiPing</h2>
    <p>An attacker can use the <a target=_blank href=https://www.multiping.com>MultiPing</a> tool to find the IP address of any IoT device in the target network. After obtaining the IP address of an IoT device, 
    the attacker can perform further scanning to identify vulnerabilities present in that device.</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Open the MultiPing application and select File > Add Address Range</ul>
        <ul>Select the router's gateway IP address from the Initial Address to Add drop-down field</ul>
        <ul>set the Number of addresses to 255</ul>
        <ul>Click OK</ul>
        <ul>MultiPing will cycle through every possible IP address in the range you have selected, and it begins testing every IP address that responds to its ping</ul>
        <ul>Each row in the MultiPing Window is a device on the network, from the list the attacker can identify the IP address of the target IoT device</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <h2>Information Gathering using FCC ID Search</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Open the device and examine the attached label</ul>
        <ul>The label has the FCC ID of the device</ul>
        <ul>Go to the <a target=_blank href=https://www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid>FCC ID search form</a></ul>
        <ul>FCC ID search will show details and a summary of the device with different frequencies</ul>
        <ul>After obtaining the required information, the attacker can find underlying vulnerabilities in the target device and launch further attacks</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>Discovering IoT devices with default credentials using IoTSeeker</h2>
    <p>Attackers use tools such as <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/rapid7/IoTSeeker>IoTSeeker</a> to discover IoT devices that are using default credentials and are vulnerable to various 
    hijacking attacks.</p>

    <h2>Vulnerability Scanning</h2>
    <p>Once the attackers gather information about a target device, they search for the attack surfaces of a device (identify the vulnerabilities).</p>

    <h2>Nmap vulnerability scanning</h2>
    <p><b><i>nmap -n -Pn -sS -pT:0-65535 -v -A -oX [Name][IP]</i></b> -> scan specific IP address</p>
    <p><b><i>nmap -n -Pn -sSU -pT:0-65535,U:0-65535 -v -A -oX [Name][IP]</i></b> -> check both TCP and UDP services and ports</p>
    <p><b><i>nmap -6 -n -Pn -sSU -pT:0-65535,U:0-65535 -v -A -oX [Name][IP]</i></b> -> check both TCP and UDP services and ports using IPv6</p>

    <h2>Vulnerability Scanning using Retina IoT (RIoT) Scanner</h2>
    <p><a target=_blank href=https://www.beyondtrust.com>Retina IoT (RIoT) Scanner</a> identifies at-risk IoT devices</p>

    <h2>Sniffing using Foren6</h2>
    <p>Attackers use tools such as <a target=_blank href=https://cetic.github.io>Foren6</a> to sniff the traffic of IoT devices. Foren6 is a non-intrusive 6LoWPAN network analysis tool.</p>

    <h2>Sniffing using Wireshark</h2>
    <p>Many IoT devices, such as security cams, host a website for controlling or configuring the cameras from a remote location. These websites mostly implement the insecure HTTP protocol instead of 
    HTTPS and are vulnerable to various attacks. If the cameras are using default factory credentials, an attacker can easily intercept all the traffic flowing between the camera and the web application 
    and further gain access to the camera itself.</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul><b><i>nmap -p 80,81,8080,8081 [Target IP address range]</i></b></ul>
        <ul>Set up the wireless card in monitor mode and identify the channel used by the target router for broadcasting, for this run <b>ifconfig</b> to identify your wireless card (wlan0)</ul>
        <ul>airmon-ng start wlan0</ul>
        <ul>airodump-ng start wlan0</ul>
        <ul>Discover the target wireless network and not down the corresponding channel to sniff the traffic using Wireshark</ul>
        <ul>Set up your wireless card to listen to the traffic on the same channel; for example if the target network's channel is 11:</ul>
        <ul>airmon-ng start wlan0 11</ul>
        <ul>Launch Wireshark and double-click the interface that was kept in monitor mode and start capturing the traffic</ul>
        <ul>After sniffing the traffic, attackers can decrypt WEP / WPA keys and hack the target IoT device to steal sensitive information</ul>

    IoT Inspector helps the attacker to breach privacy and security mechanisms. This tool projects the vulnerabilities in the form of tables and graphs. It also allows the attacker to record and 
    replay all information from the communicating devices to gather sensitive information. IoT Inspector automatically scans and displays the available devices in the network.</p>

    <h1>Launch Attacks</h1>
    <p>Vulnerabilities found are exploited further to launch various attacks</p>
    <h2>Rolling Code Attack using RFCrack</h2>
    <p>Attackers use the <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/cclabsInc/RFCrack>RFCrack</a> tool to obtain the rolling code sent by the victim to unlock a vehicle and later use the same code 
    for unlocking and stealing the vehicle.</p>
    <h2>Hacking ZigBee devices with Attify ZigBee Framework</h2>
    <p>Most IoT devices use the ZigBee protocol for short-range wilreless communication. Attackers find vulnerabilities using tools as the <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/cclabsInc/RFCrack>Attify ZigBee Framework</a>.
    The framework consists of a set of tools used to perform ZigBee penetration testing.</p>
    <h2>BlueBorne Attack using HackRF One</h2>
    <p>IoT devices involve wireless communication using RF, ZigBee or LoRa. Attackers use <a target=_blank href=https://greatscottgadgets.com>HackRF One</a> to perform attacks such as BlueBorne or AirBorne attacks, 
    including replay, fuzzing and jamming. HackRF One is an advanced hardware- and software-defined radio with a range of 1 MHz to 6 GHz. It transmits and receives radio waves in half-duplex mode, so it is easy 
    for attackers to perform attacks using this device. It can sniff a wide range of wireless protocols from GSM to Z-wave. The attacker records and replays the signal.</p>
    <h2>SDR-Based attacks using RTL-SDR and GNU Radio</h2>
    <p>Attackers use hardware tools such as <a target=_blank href=https://www.rtl-sdr.com>RTL-SDR</a> to perform SDR-based attacks on IoT devices. RTL-STR hardware is available in the form of a USB dongle that 
    can be used to capture active radio signals in the vicinity. It is available in different models, such as DVB-T SDR, RTL2832, RTL dongle, DVB-T dongle.</p>
    <p>Attackers can use an RTL-SDR radio scanner to perform the following activities:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Receiving and decoding GPS signals</ul>
        <ul>Analyzing spectrum</ul>
        <ul>Listening to DAB broadcast radio</ul>
        <ul>Listening to and decoding HD radio</ul>
        <ul>Sniffing GSM signals</ul>
        <ul>Listening to VHF amateur radio</ul>

    </ol></p>
    <p>Along with hardware tools, attackers can also assault SDR-based IoT devices using various software tools such as <a target=_blank href=https://www.gnuradio.org>GNU Radio</a></p>

    <h2>Side-Channel Attack using ChipWhisperer</h2>
    <p><a target=_blank href=https://newae.com>ChipWhispere</a> is an open-source toolchain mainly used for embedded hardware security research and for performing side-channel power analysis and glitching 
    attacks. These attacks are mainly used to extract cryptographic keys from a system.</p>
    <p>A <b>Side-channel attack</b> is a cryptographic attack that leverages the implementation of the physical system to gain information, such as information regarding power consumption, time, sound and 
    electromagnetic leaks, instead of exploiting the vulnerabilities in the code. For these attacks, special hardware is needed (capture board and target board).</p>

    <h2>Identifying IoT communication buses and interfaces</h2>
    <p>Attackers identify various serial and parallel interfaces such as universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART), serial peripheral interface (SPI), joint test action group (JTAG) and 
    inter-integrated circuit (I2C) to gain access to a shell, extract firmware etc. Attackers use tools such as BUS Auditor, Damn Insecure and Vulnerable Application (DIVA), a printed circuit board 
    (PCB) and the EXPloit framework to identify buses. </p>

    <h2>NAND Glitching</h2>
    <p>Attackers often focus on gaining privileged access to IoT devices or routers by exploiting their booting vulnerabilities using techniques such as glitching. NAND glitching is the process of gaining 
    privileged root access while booting a device, which can be performed by making a ground connection to the serial I/O pin of a flash memory chip.</p>

    <h1>Gain Remote Access</h1>
    <p>Vulnerabilities identified in the vulnerability-scanning phase allow an attacker to remotely gain access and command and control the attack while evading detection from various security products. 
    Based on the vulnerabilities in an IoT device, the attacker may turn the device into a backdoor to gain access to an organization's network without infecting any end system that is protected by IDS/IPS, 
    firewall, antivirus software etc. After gaining remote access, attackers use these devices as a platform to launch attacks on other devices in the network.</p>
    <h2>Telnet</h2>
    <p>Attackers perform port scanning to learn about open ports and services on the target IoT device. If the attacker identifies that the telnet port is open, he exploits this vulnerability to gain 
    remote access to the device. Many embedded system applications in IoT devices support Telnet.</p>

    <h1>Maintain Access</h1>
    <p>Once gaining access to the device, the attacker uses various techniques to maintain access and perform further exploitation. Attackers remain undetected by clearing logs, updating firmware and using
    malicious programs such as backdoors, trojans etc. to maintain access. Attackers use tools such as Firmware Mod Kit, Firmwalker, Firmalyzer Enterprise and Firmware Analysis Toolkit to exploit firmware.</p>
    <h2>Maintain Access by Exploiting Firmware</h2>
    <p><a target=_blank href=https://github.com/rampageX/firmware-mod-kit>Firmware Mod Kit</a> allows for easy deconstruction and reconstruction of firmware images for various embedded devices. </p>
    <h2>Firmware Analysis and Reverse Engineering</h2>
    <p>Firmware acts as the central point in controlling various IoT devices. Attackers analyze the firmware of the target IoT devices to uncover the underlying loopholes and vulnerabilities. Firmware 
    analysis is performed to identify the passwords, API tokens and endpoints, vulnerable services running, backdoor accounts, configuration files in use, private keys, stored data etc.</p>
