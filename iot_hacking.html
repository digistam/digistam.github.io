<h1>Hacking IOT</h1>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from the convergence of wireless technology, micro-electromechanical systems, micro-services and the internet. IoT solutions are applied in different sectors of 
industry, including healthcare, building management, agriculture, energy and transport. IoT devices such as wearables, industrial appliances, connected electronic devices, smart grids and smart vehicles, are
becoming part of interconnected networks. These devices generate a huge amount of data that is collected, analyzed, logged and stored on the networks.</p>

<h1>What is the IoT</h1>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT), aka Internet of Everything (IoE) refers to computer devices that are web-enabled and have the capability of sensing, collecting and sending data using sensors, and the 
communication hardware and processors that are embedded within the device. In the IoT, a <b>thing</b> refers to a device that is implanted in a natural, human-made or machine-made object and has the functionality 
of communicating over a network (<i>een device dat is geïmplanteerd in een natuurlijk, door mensen gemaakt of door machines gemaakt object dat de functionaliteit heeft om te communiceren via een netwerk</i>).</p>
<p>IoT utilizes emerging technology for sensing, networking and robotics, therefore allowing the user to achieve deeper analysis, automation and integration within a system.</p>
<h2>How the IoT works</h2>
<p>IoT technology includes four primary systems: IoT devices, gateway systems, data storage systems using cloud technology and remote control using mobile apps. These systems together make communication between 
to endpoints possible. Important components of IoT technology that play an essential role in the function of a IoT device:</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Sensing Technology (temperature, gass, location, health data etc.)</ul>
  <ul>IoT Gateways (gateways bridge the gap between an IoT device (internal network) and the end-user (external network), allowing them to communicate with each other; data collected by the sensors in the IoT device 
  is sent to the connected user of cloud through the gateway)</ul>
  <ul>Cloud Server / Data Storage (storage of data; analysis of data and sending to end-user)</ul>
  <ul>Remote control using Mobile app (end-user uses remote controls such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops etc. installed with a mobile app to monitor, control, retrieve data and take a specific action on IoT
  devices from a remote location)</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Example: a smart security system installed in a home will be integrated with a <b>gateway</b>, which in turn helps to connect the device to the internet and the cloud infrastructure. The connection with the 
cloud server is established through web services. The user on the other side, who has the required app to access the device remotely on his phone, interacts with it, which in turn allows him to interact with the 
device at home. Before accessing the device, he is asked to authenticate himself. If the credentials submitted by him match those saved in the cloud, he is granted access. The cloud server identifies the 
device's ID and sends a request associated with that device using gateways. If the smart security system senses any unusual activity, then sends an alert to the cloud through the gateway, which matches the 
device's ID and the user associated with it, and the end-user receives an alert.</p>

    <h1>IoT architecture</h1>
    <p>The IoT architecture includes several layers, from the application layer at the top to the edge technology layer at the bottom.</p>
