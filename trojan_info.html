<h1>Trojans</h1>

<p>Computer Trojans are closely related to <a href=APT.html>APT</a>. A Trojan refers to the Trojan War in ancient Greek mythology. A computer Trojan is a program in which malicious or harmful code is contained inside an apparently harmless program or data, which can later gain control 
  and cause damage, such as ruining the FAT. Computer trojans are used to trick a victim into performing a predefined action.</p>
  <p>A Trojan is wrapped within or attached to a legitimate program. Victims are used as unwitting intermediaries to attack others. A victim's computer can be used to commit illegal DoS attacks.</p>
  <p>Trojans work at the same level of privileges as the victims and can attempt to exploit vulnerabilities to increase the level of access. If succesful, the Trojan can use such increased privileges to install other malicious 
  code on the victim's machine.</p>
  <p>A Trojan, depending on the actions it performs, may falsely implicate a remote system as the source of an attack by spoofing, thereby causing the remote system to incur a liability. Trojans enter the system by email attachments, 
  downloads and instant messages.</p>
  <h2>Common Ports used by Trojans</h2>
  <p>Trojans use client and server. Various Trojans use specific ports to infect target systems. Among the various states, the "listening" state is the important one in this context. The system generates this state when it listens for a port number while waiting 
  to connect to another system. Whenever a system reboots, Trojens move to the listening state; some use more than one port: one for "listening" and the other(s) for data transfer.</p>

  </ol></p>
<h2>Remote Access Trojans (RAT)</h2>
<p>RATs provide attackers with full control over the victim's system, thereby enabling them to remotely access files, private conversations, accounting data etc. The RAT acts as a server and listens on a port that is not supposed 
to be available to Internet attackers. If the user is behind a firewall, it is less likely that a remote attacker will connect to the Trojans. Attackers in the same network located behind the firewall can easily access Trojans.
 RATs are used to infect the target machine to gain administrative access. RATs help to access and control the computer. Infection by phishing attacks and drive-by downloads, via infected USB keys or networked drives. RATs can
download and execute additional malware, execute shell commands, read and write registry keys, capture screenshots, log keystrokes, spy on webcams.</p>

<ol>
  <ul>Remotely access the victim's computer</ul>
  <ul>Collect victim's information such as IP, hostname and OS</ul>
  <ul>Manipulate files and system files</ul>
  <ul>Open active remote session providing the attacker access to the command line of the victim's machine</ul>
  <ul>Log keystrokes and steal credentials from browsers</ul>

<h2>Backdoor Trojans</h2>
<p>A backdoor is a program that can bypass the standard system authentication or conventional system mechanisms like IDS and firewalls, without being detected. In these types of breaches, hackers leverage backdoor programs to access the victim's computer or network.
The difference with other types of malware is that the installation of the backdoor is performed without the user's knowledge.</p>
    <p>Backdoor Trojans are often used to group victim computers to form a botnet or zombie network that can be used to perform criminal activities. Often,
     Backdoor Trojans are initially used in the second (point of entry) or third (command and control C&C) stage of the targeted attack process. </p>
    <p>The Backdoor Trojan has a user interface, client component, which can be used by the attacker to issue command to the server component residing in the compromised machine.
     A traditional backdoor does NOT have a GUI!</p>
    <h2>Example: <a target=_blank href=https://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/backdoor-w32-poisonivy.shtml>PoisonIvy</a></h2>
    <p>PoisonIvy gives the attacker almost complete control over the infected computer. The PoisonIvy remote administration tool is
     created and controlled by a <a target=_blank href=https://www.securityweek.com/poison-ivy-kit-enables-easy-malware-customization-attackers/>PoisonIvy management program or kit</a>. The PoisonIvy kit consists 
    of a graphical user interface and the backdoors are small (< 10kb). Once the backdoor is executed, it copies itself to either the
     Windows folder or the Windows\system32 folder. The filename and locations of the backdoor are defined by the creator of the backdoor 
    when using the PoisonIvy kit to create the server program. Some variants of PoisonIvy can copy themselves into an alternative 
    data stream. </p>
    <p>Everytime the computer is booted up, the backdoor is started because of a <b>registry entry</b>. The server automatically connects 
    to a client using an address defined when the server part was created. The communication between the server and client programs is 
    <b>encrypted</b> and <b>compressed</b>. PoisonIvy can be configured to inject itself into a <b>browser process</b> before making an 
    outgoing connection to bypass firewalls.</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>File modification, deletion and transfer to and from the infected system</ul>
        <ul>Windows registry can be viewed and edited</ul>
        <ul>Currently running processes can be viewed, suspended and killed</ul>
        <ul>Current network connections can be viewed and shut down</ul>
        <ul>Services can be viewed and controlled (stopped/started)</ul>
        <ul>Installed devices can be viewed, entries can be deleted or programs can be uninstalled</ul>
        <ul>The list of installed applications can be viewed, entries can be deleted or programs can be uninstalled</ul>
        <ul>Accesses Windows command shell on the infected computer</ul>
        <ul>Steals information by taking screenshots of the desktop and recording audio / webcam</ul>
        <ul>Accesses saved passwords and password hashes</ul>
