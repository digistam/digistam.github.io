<h1>Trojans</h1>

<p>A Trojan refers to the Trojan War in ancient Greek mythology. A computer Trojan is a program in which malicious or harmful code is contained inside an apparently harmless program or data, which can later gain control 
  and cause damage, such as ruining the FAT. Computer trojans are used to trick a victim into performing a predefined action.</p>
  <p>A Trojan is wrapped within or attached to a legitimate program. Victims are used as unwitting intermediaries to attack others. A victim's computer can be used to commit illegal DoS attacks.</p>
  <p>Trojans work at the same level of privileges as the victims and can attempt to exploit vulnerabilities to increase the level of access. If succesful, the Trojan can use such increased privileges to install other malicious 
  code on the victim's machine.</p>
  <p>A Trojan, depending on the actions it performs, may falsely implicate a remote system as the source of an attack by spoofing, thereby causing the remote system to incur a liability. Trojans enter the system by email attachments, 
  downloads and instant messages.</p>
  <h2>Common Ports used by Trojans</h2>
  <p>Trojans use client and server. Various Trojans use specific ports to infect target systems. Among the various states, the "listening" state is the important one in this context. The system generates this state when it listens for a port number while waiting 
  to connect to another system. Whenever a system reboots, Trojens move to the listening state; some use more than one port: one for "listening" and the other(s) for data transfer.</p>

  </ol></p>
<h2>Remote Access Trojans (RAT)</h2>
<p>RATs provide attackers with full control over the victim's system, thereby enabling them to remotely access files, private conversations, accounting data etc. The RAT acts as a server and listens on a port that is not supposed 
to be available to Internet attackers. If the user is behind a firewall, it is less likely that a remote attacker will connect to the Trojans. Attackers in the same network located behind the firewall can easily access Trojans.
 RATs are used to infect the target machine to gain administrative access. RATs help to access and control the computer. Infection by phishing attacks and drive-by downloads, via infected USB keys or networked drives. RATs can
download and execute additional malware, execute shell commands, read and write registry keys, capture screenshots, log keystrokes, spy on webcams.</p>

<ol>
  <ul>Remotely access the victim's computer</ul>
  <ul>Collect victim's information such as IP, hostname and OS</ul>
  <ul>Manipulate files and system files</ul>
  <ul>Open active remote session providing the attacker access to the command line of the victim's machine</ul>
  <ul>Log keystrokes and steal credentials from browsers</ul>
