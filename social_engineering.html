<h1>Social Engineering</h1>

  <h2>Social Engineering Concepts</h2>
<p>Social engineering is the art of manipulating people to divulge sensitive information to use it to perform some malicious action. It targets the weakness of people. Attackers take a special interest in developing 
  social engineering skills and can be so proficient that the victims might not even notice the fraud. Attackers ensure they know the organization's perimeter and the people on its perimeter such as security guards, 
  receptionists, help-desk workers etc.</p>
  <h2>Common Targets</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Receptionists and Help-Desk Personnel</ul>
    <ul>Technical Support Executives</ul>
    <ul>System Administrators</ul>
    <ul>Users and Clients</ul>
    <ul>Vendors of the Target organization</ul>
    <ul>Senior Executives</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Behaviors Vulnerable to Attacks</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Authority</ul>
    <ul>Intimidations</ul>
    <ul>Concensus or Social Proof</ul>
    <ul>Scarcity</ul>
    <ul>Urgency</ul>
    <ul>Familiarity or Liking</ul>
    <ul>Trust</ul>
    <ul>Greed</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Factors that make companies vulnerable to attacks</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Insufficient Security Training</ul>
    <ul>Unregulated Access to Information</ul>
    <ul>Several Organizational Units</ul>
    <ul>Lack of Security Policies</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Phases of Social Engineering Attack</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Research the target company</ul>
    <ul>Select a target (disgruntled employees)</ul>
    <ul>Develop a relationship</ul>
    <ul>Exploit the relationship</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Social Engineering Techniques</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Human-based Social Engineering</ul>
    <ul>Computer-based Social Engineering</ul>
    <ul>Mobile-based Social Engineering</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Human-based Social Engineering</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Impersonation -> attacker pretends to be legitimate or authorized person</ul>
    <ul>Vishing -> (voice or VoIP phishing) impersonation using voice to trick individuals, using Caller ID spoofing, pre-recorded messages and instructions resembling a legitimate financial institution</ul>
    <ul>Eavesdropping -> listening to a conversation or reading others' messages</ul>
    <ul>Shoulder surfing -> looking over someone's shoulder as the key information into a device</ul>
    <ul>Dumpster diving -> retrieving sensitive information by searching through trash bins</ul>
    <ul>Reverse Social Engineering -> perpetrator assumes the role of a knowledgeable professional so that the organization's employees ask them for information, the attacker manipulates questions to draw out the required information</ul>
    <ul>Piggybacking -> entry into a building or area with consent of the authorized person (hey, I forgot my ID badge, please let me in!)</ul>
    <ul>Tailgating -> entry into a building or area without consent of the authorized persion (wearing a fake badge, closey following an authorized person through a door that requires key access)</ul>
    <ul>Diversion Theft -> delivery professionals or transport companies deliver consignement to a wrong location where the goods are stolen</ul>
    <ul>Honey Trap -> attractive person begins a fake relationship with the victim</ul>
    <ul>Baiting -> attackers offer something alluring in exchange for information (also: usb flash drive dropped on the floor)</ul>
    <ul>Quid Pro Quo -> something for something, attackers keep calling random numbers claiming to be calling from technical support, baiting technique</ul>
    <ul>Elicitation -> extracting specific information from the victim by involving him in normal and disarming conversations, using good social skills</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Computer-based Social Engineering</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Phishing -> the attacker registers a fake domain name, builds a lookalike website and mails the website link to users</ul>
    <ul>Spear Phising -> specialized social engineering content directed at specific employee(s)</ul>
    <ul>Whaling -> phishing high profile executives like CEO, CFO, politicians, celebrities</ul>
    <ul>Pharming -> redirecting urls to attacker controlled websites using DNS cache poisoning and host file modification, phishing without a lure</ul>
    <ul>Spimming -> spam over instant messaging</ul>
    <ul>Angler Phishing -> targetting disgruntled users or customers over sociale media platforms</ul>
    <ul>Catfishing -> identity theft, creating a fake profile and masquerade as the owner of the account, asking for money</ul>
    <ul>Deepfake attack -> phishing using deepfake, blackmail etc.</ul>
    <ul>Spam mail</ul>
    <ul>Instant Chat messenger</ul>
    <ul>Pop-up window attacks -> clicking a hyperlink button that redirects to fake web pages asking for personal information</ul>
    <ul>Hoax letters</ul>
    <ul>Chain letters -> pyarmid games</ul>
    <ul>Scareware</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Mobile-based Social Engineering</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Publishing malicious apps -> creating a malicious app and publishing it on major application stores using popular names</ul>
    <ul>Repackaging legitimate apps -> downloading legitimate app, repack it with malware and uploading it to third party application store</ul>
    <ul>Using fake security applications -> pop-ups telling the end user they need to download an application to their phone</ul>
    <ul>SMiShing (SMS Phishing) -> luring users to malicious website</ul>
  </ol></p>

  <h1>Impersonation on Social Networking Sites</h1>
  <h2>Social Engineering through impersonation on social networking sites</h2>
  <p>Two ways impersonation occurs:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Creating fictitious profile of the victim</ul>

  </ol></p>

  <h2>Impersonation on Facebook</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Create a fake user group on Facebook identified as "Employees of" the target company</ul>
    <ul>Using a false identity, proceed to "friend" or invite actual employees</ul>
    <ul>Users join the group and provide their credentials such as date of birth, educational and employment backgrounds etc.</ul>
    <ul>Using the details of any one of the employees, an attacker can compromise a secured facility to gain access to the building</ul>
  </ol></p>

  <h2>Types of Identity Theft</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Child Identity Theft</ul>
    <ul>Criminal Identity Theft</ul>

    <ul>Social Identity Theft</ul>
  </ol></p>

    <ul><a target=_blank href=https://portal.ohphish.com>OhPhish</a></ul>
  </ol></p>

    <p>The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) is an open source Python driven tool aimed at penetration testing via social engineering. It is freely available and can be used to carry out a range of 
    attacks. It allows attackers to draft email messages, attach malicious files and send them to a large number of people using spear phising. SET's multi-attack method allows Java applets, 
    the Metasploit browser, Credential Harvester/Tabnabbing to be used simultaneously. </p>
    <p>. It serves as a comprehensive toolbox for professionals to understand, simulate, and test the vulnerabilities associated with social engineering.
        SET offers an extensive range of tools and functionalities tailored to craft and deploy diverse social engineering attacks. These attacks encompass 
        phishing campaigns, credential harvesting, the creation of malicious websites, and the generation of exploitative payloads, all engineered to exploit 
        human psychology rather than solely relying on technical vulnerabilities.</p>
    
    <h2>Using Social Engineer Toolkit (SET)</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>The Social Engineer Toolkit already comes pre-installed in Kali</ul>
        <ul>sudo setoolkit</ul>
        <ul><a target=_blank href=https://www.stationx.net/social-engineer-toolkit/>Example 1</a></ul>
        <ul><a target=_blank href=https://medium.com/@careertechnologymiraroad/social-engineer-toolkit-ab15a7f233b6>Example 2</a></ul>
        <ul>Step 1: Open kali terminal and start by entering command “sudo setoolkit” after that type the password and click enter.</ul>
        <ul>Step 2: Now a menu will appear, from that we will select social-engineering attacks option by typing the number allotted to the 
            option for credential harvesting. So here type 1 and then press enter</ul>
        <ul>Social-Engineering Attacks >> Website Attack Vectors >> Credential Harvester Attack Method >> Site Cloner</ul>
        <ul>The login page is cloned and can be presented to the victim</ul>
        <ul>The victim enters e-mail address and password and clicks enter</ul>
        <ul>The e-mail address and password appear in Kali, while the webpage shows the original loginpage</ul>
        <ul>The victim will think something has gone wrong and enters his credentials again and access is granted</ul>
    </ol></p>
