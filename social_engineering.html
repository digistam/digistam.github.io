<h1>Social Engineering</h1>

  <h2>Social Engineering Concepts</h2>
<p>Social engineering is the art of manipulating people to divulge sensitive information to use it to perform some malicious action. It targets the weakness of people. Attackers take a special interest in developing 
  social engineering skills and can be so proficient that the victims might not even notice the fraud. Attackers ensure they know the organization's perimeter and the people on its perimeter such as security guards, 
  receptionists, help-desk workers etc.</p>
  <h2>Common Targets</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Receptionists and Help-Desk Personnel</ul>
    <ul>Technical Support Executives</ul>
    <ul>System Administrators</ul>
    <ul>Users and Clients</ul>
    <ul>Vendors of the Target organization</ul>
    <ul>Senior Executives</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Behaviors Vulnerable to Attacks</h2>

    <ul>Insufficient Security Training</ul>
    <ul>Unregulated Access to Information</ul>
    <ul>Several Organizational Units</ul>
    <ul>Lack of Security Policies</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Phases of Social Engineering Attack</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Research the target company</ul>
    <ul>Select a target (disgruntled employees)</ul>
    <ul>Develop a relationship</ul>
    <ul>Exploit the relationship</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Social Engineering Techniques</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Human-based Social Engineering</ul>
    <ul>Computer-based Social Engineering</ul>
    <ul>Mobile-based Social Engineering</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Human-based Social Engineering</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Impersonation -> attacker pretends to be legitimate or authorized person</ul>
    <ul>Vishing -> (voice or VoIP phishing) impersonation using voice to trick individuals, using Caller ID spoofing, pre-recorded messages and instructions resembling a legitimate financial institution</ul>
    <ul>Eavesdropping -> listening to a conversation or reading others' messages</ul>
    <ul>Shoulder surfing -> looking over someone's shoulder as the key information into a device</ul>
    <ul>Dumpster diving -> retrieving sensitive information by searching through trash bins</ul>
    <ul>Reverse Social Engineering -> perpetrator assumes the role of a knowledgeable professional so that the organization's employees ask them for information, the attacker manipulates questions to draw out the required information</ul>
    <ul>Piggybacking -> entry into a building or area with consent of the authorized person (hey, I forgot my ID badge, please let me in!)</ul>
    <ul>Tailgating -> entry into a building or area without consent of the authorized persion (wearing a fake badge, closey following an authorized person through a door that requires key access)</ul>
    <ul>Diversion Theft -> delivery professionals or transport companies deliver consignement to a wrong location where the goods are stolen</ul>
    <ul>Honey Trap -> attractive person begins a fake relationship with the victim</ul>
    <ul>Baiting -> attackers offer something alluring in exchange for information (also: usb flash drive dropped on the floor)</ul>
    <ul>Quid Pro Quo -> something for something, attackers keep calling random numbers claiming to be calling from technical support, baiting technique</ul>
    <ul>Elicitation -> extracting specific information from the victim by involving him in normal and disarming conversations, using good social skills</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Computer-based Social Engineering</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Phishing -> the attacker registers a fake domain name, builds a lookalike website and mails the website link to users</ul>
    <ul>Spear Phising -> specialized social engineering content directed at specific employee(s)</ul>
    <ul>Whaling -> phishing high profile executives like CEO, CFO, politicians, celebrities</ul>
    <ul>Pharming -> redirecting urls to attacker controlled websites using DNS cache poisoning and host file modification, phishing without a lure</ul>
    <ul>Spimming -> spam over instant messaging</ul>
    <ul>Clone Phishing -> attacker creates a replica (clone) of a legit e-mail, website or other digital content; attacker creates nearly identical copy which contains a link or attachment and may have been 
        previously received in its original form. Then, the attacker modifies certain elements, typically the link or attachment, to point to a malicious destination. If the victim falls for the cloned email
        and clicks on the link or opens the attachment, they are redirected to the malicious website</ul>
    <ul>E-wallet phishing -> target users of electronic wallets, aiming them to reveal login credentials, personal information or financial details; Initiallyl, the attacker sends a phishing email or messages 
        to potential victims, posing as legit e-wallet providers. Once users land on the fake website, they are prompted to enter their login credentials, personal information or financial details, which the 
        attackers capture in real time</ul>
    <ul>Tabnabbing and Reverse Tabnabbing -> social engineering attacks that target web users who have multiple tabs open in their web browser. These attacks exploit the user's tendency to switch between tabs
        without always checking the content of each tab. In a tabnabbing attack, a malicious actor crafts a webpage with code that detects when the user switches to another tab. While the user is focused on 
        another tab, the malicious webpage dynamically changes its content to mimic a legitimate website that the user might have opened in one of their other tabs, such as a login page or a banking website. 
        The user while returning to the tab containing the malicious webpage may be deceived into entering their login credentials or sensitive information, thinking they are interacting with the legitimate 
        website. The attacker then captures the entered credentials or information, potentially leading to account takeover, identity theft or other malicious activites</ul>
      <ul>Reverse tabnabbing attack -> the attacker hosts a legit website and tricks users into clicking on a link that opens a new tab. The malicious link contains code that changes the content of the
          original tab to a phishing page or another malicious website. The user may not notice this change when they return to the original tab and then unknowingly enters their credentials or sensitive 
          information, believing they are interacting with the legit website. This technique is particularly effective because users are more likely to trust content in tabs that they themselves opened</ul>
      <ul>Consent Phishing -> attacks the OAuth authentication protocol used by a.o. Google, Facebook and Microsoft. The attacker develops a legit looking fake application or website and lures the victim 
          to visit it through various means, such as phishing emails, social media posts or online ads. Once the victim is on the site, the attacker uses persuasive language or misleading tactics to prompt 
          the victim to grant permissions to access their account. Upon granting consent, the attacker gains access to the victim's account without actually having credential access and obtains information, 
          including email addresses, contacts, profile data etc. and can even send spam emails or access other linked accounts</ul>
      <ul>Search Enging Phishing -> involves attackers manipulating search engine results, leading users to visit fraudulent websites crafted to steal sensitive information or distribute malware. Attackers use 
          various techniques such as search engine optimization (SEO) manipulation, keyword stuffing etc. Fraudulent websites employ various tactics, incl. fake login pages, counterfeit forms, misleading content
          to trick users into revealing their login credentials, personal information or financial details, or unknowingly downloading malware</ul>
    <ul>Angler Phishing -> targetting disgruntled users or customers over sociale media platforms</ul>
    <ul>Catfishing -> identity theft, creating a fake profile and masquerade as the owner of the account, asking for money</ul>
    <ul>Deepfake attack -> phishing using deepfake, blackmail etc.</ul>
    <ul>Spam mail</ul>
    <ul>Instant Chat messenger</ul>
    <ul>Pop-up window attacks -> clicking a hyperlink button that redirects to fake web pages asking for personal information</ul>
    <ul>Hoax letters</ul>
    <ul>Chain letters -> pyramid games</ul>
    <ul>Scareware</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Mobile-based Social Engineering</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Publishing malicious apps -> creating a malicious app and publishing it on major application stores using popular names</ul>
    <ul>Repackaging legitimate apps -> downloading legitimate app, repack it with malware and uploading it to third party application store</ul>
    <ul>Using fake security applications -> pop-ups telling the end user they need to download an application to their phone</ul>
    <ul>SMiShing (SMS Phishing) -> luring users to malicious website</ul>
  </ol></p>

  <h2>Phising Tools</h2>

    <h1>Crafting Phishing Emails with ChatGPT</h1>
    <p>Attackers can leverage AI - powered technologies to enhance social engineering tasks. With the aid of AI, attackers can effortlessly create and craft phishing emails to perform social 
    engineering. Crafting phishing emails using AI can be a deceptive, yet effective, strategy in cyber fraud. Leveraging the language generation capabilities of AI, individuals with malicious 
    intent can create convincing emails designed to trick recipients into divulging sensitive information or performing harmful actions. Using AI, attackers can also create convincing phishing 
    emails designed to trick employees into downloading malware. By mimicking the language and style of legitimate communications, these emails can appear authentic and bypass traditional security 
    measures. They often employ urgent requests or enticing offers to manipulate recipients into clicking malicious links or opening infected attachments, thus compromising the organization's 
    cybersecurity defenses. Vigilance and employee training are crucial in combating such threats.</p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p><i>Pose as a genuine Microsoft customer support executive with imaginary name; write a concise mail stating that he/she has found suspicious login on user's account and ask them to reset the 
    password on urgent basis. Provide the reset link at [Fake Reset Link]</i>i</p>
    <p>The advantage of using ChatGPT for crafting phishing emails lie in its ability to generate diverse and contextually relevant content swiftly, reducing the time and effort required for manual 
    composition. Additionaly, the dynamic nature of the model allows for the customization of emails based on evovling trends and recipient responses, enhancing the effectiveness of the phishing 
    campaign. However, it is essential to recognize the ethical implications and potential legal consequences of using AI for malicious purposes, underscoring the importance of responsible AI 
    usage and cybersecurity awareness.</p>

    <ul><a target=_blank href=https://portal.ohphish.com>OhPhish</a></ul>
  </ol></p>

    <p>The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) is an open source Python driven tool aimed at penetration testing via social engineering. It is freely available and can be used to carry out a range of 
    attacks. It allows attackers to draft email messages, attach malicious files and send them to a large number of people using spear phising. SET's multi-attack method allows Java applets, 
    the Metasploit browser, Credential Harvester/Tabnabbing to be used simultaneously. </p>
    <p>. It serves as a comprehensive toolbox for professionals to understand, simulate, and test the vulnerabilities associated with social engineering.
        SET offers an extensive range of tools and functionalities tailored to craft and deploy diverse social engineering attacks. These attacks encompass 
        phishing campaigns, credential harvesting, the creation of malicious websites, and the generation of exploitative payloads, all engineered to exploit 
        human psychology rather than solely relying on technical vulnerabilities.</p>
    
    <h2>Using Social Engineer Toolkit (SET)</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>The Social Engineer Toolkit already comes pre-installed in Kali</ul>
        <ul>sudo setoolkit</ul>
        <ul><a target=_blank href=https://www.stationx.net/social-engineer-toolkit/>Example 1</a></ul>
        <ul><a target=_blank href=https://medium.com/@careertechnologymiraroad/social-engineer-toolkit-ab15a7f233b6>Example 2</a></ul>
        <ul>Step 1: Open kali terminal and start by entering command “sudo setoolkit” after that type the password and click enter.</ul>
        <ul>Step 2: Now a menu will appear, from that we will select social-engineering attacks option by typing the number allotted to the 
            option for credential harvesting. So here type 1 and then press enter</ul>
        <ul>Social-Engineering Attacks >> Website Attack Vectors >> Credential Harvester Attack Method >> Site Cloner</ul>
        <ul>The login page is cloned and can be presented to the victim</ul>
        <ul>The victim enters e-mail address and password and clicks enter</ul>
        <ul>The e-mail address and password appear in Kali, while the webpage shows the original loginpage</ul>
        <ul>The victim will think something has gone wrong and enters his credentials again and access is granted</ul>
    </ol></p>
