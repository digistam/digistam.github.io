<h1>Vulnerability scanners</h1>
<p>I like to work with metasploit, db_nmap etc. in combination with <a target=_blank href=https://digistam.github.io/method/nmap_cve.html>CVE detection</a>, however
  i find the results very unclear at times. In order to have a good overview of vulnerabilities on my network(s) I have installed two virtual machines:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul><a target=_blank href=https://www.greenbone.net/en/testnow/>Greenbone Enterprise Trial</a></ul>
    <ul><a target=_blank href=https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials>Nessus Essentials</a></ul>
  </ol></p>
  <p>I compared the results of both vulnerability scanners to see which one is best for my situation.</p>
  <h2>Greenbone</h2>
  <p>I like to call this one <b>OpenVAS</b>. There are no limits with regard to the amount of IP addresses you can scan.</p>
