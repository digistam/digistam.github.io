<h1>Vulnerability scanners</h1>
<p>I like to work with metasploit, db_nmap etc. in combination with <a target=_blank href=https://digistam.github.io/method/nmap_cve.html>CVE detection</a>, however
  i find the results very unclear at times. In order to have a good overview of vulnerabilities on my network(s) I have installed two virtual machines:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul><a target=_blank href=https://www.greenbone.net/en/testnow/>Greenbone Enterprise Trial</a></ul>
    <ul><a target=_blank href=https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials>Nessus Essentials</a></ul>
  </ol></p>
  <p>I compared the results of both vulnerability scanners to see which one is best for my situation.</p>
  <h2>Greenbone</h2>
  <p>I like to call this one <b>OpenVAS</b>. There are no limits with regard to the amount of IP addresses you can scan. It works fine with (bridged) VMware workstation. Standard 
      login is admin:admin. It was not clear to me how to <a target=_blank href=https://docs.greenbone.net/GSM-Manual/gos-21.04/en/managing-gos.html#performing-a-feed-update>update the feeds. 
      It turned out the feed server was not reachable at all from my VMware machine. To make a long story short: I downloaded and installed the trial version of the Enterprise version, 
      and I would like to have the <a target=_blank href=https://greenbone.github.io/docs/latest/22.4/container/index.html>Greenbone Community Edition</a>, because I will never pay for 
          a commercial version.</p> 
<h2>Install Greenbone Community Edition in Kali</h2>
    <p>I found out it is best to install the free OpenVAS on the Kali machine. When it's running on localhost, it's possible to use it in Metasploit :-) When it's running in 
    separate VMware, Metasploit can't connect to it.</p>
