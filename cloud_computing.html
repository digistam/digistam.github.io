<h1>Separation of responsibilities in Cloud</h1>
<p>The separation of responsibilities of subscribers and service providers is essential. Separation of duties prevents conflict of interest, illegal acts, fraud, abuse and error and helps in identifying 
security control failures, including information theft, security breaches and evasion of security controls.</p>
<p>There are mainly three types of cloud services: IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. It is essential to know the limitations of each cloud service delivery model.</p>
<h1>Cloud Deployment Models</h1>
<p>The five standard cloud deployment models:</p>
<h2>Public Cloud</h2>
<p>Makes services such as applications, servers and data storage available to the public over the internet; the provider is liable for the creation and maintenance of the public cloud and its IT resources, 
Google App Engine, Amazon EC2, Windows Azure etc.</p>
<h2>Private Cloud</h2>
<p>aka Internal cloud, corporate cloud; cloud infrastructure operated by a single organization and with a corporate firewall, VMware vRealize Suite, SAP Cloud Platform etc.</p>
<h2>Community Cloud</h2>
<p>Multi-tenant infrastructure shared among organizations from a specific community with common computing concerns, Cisco Cloud Solutions, Salesforce Health Control etc.</p>
<h2>Hybrid Cloud</h2>
<p>Cloud environment comprised of two of more clouds (public, private or community), Microsoft Azure, Zymr, Logicalis; example: an organization performs it's critical activities on the private cloud and non-
critical activities on the public cloud</p>
<h2>Multi Cloud</h2>
<p>Dynamic heterogeneous environment that combines workloads across multiple cloud vendors that are managed via one proprietary interface </p>
<h2>Distributed Cloud</h2>
<p>Centralized cloud environment comprised of geographically distributed public or private clouds controlled on a single control plane for providing services to the end users located on or off site</p>
<h2>Poly Cloud</h2>
<p>Several types of cloud services, which can be supplied to different other clouds</p>

<h1>NIST Cloud Deployment Reference Architecture</h1>
<p>Five significant actors:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Cloud Consumer -> PaaS, IaaS, SaaS</ul>
    <ul>Cloud Provider</ul>
    <ul>Cloud Carrier -> intermediary providing connectivity and transport between cloud consumers</ul>
    <ul>Cloud Auditor -> independent examination of cloud services</ul>
    <ul>Cloud Broker -> integration of cloud services is too complicated for cloud consumers and they may request cloud services from a cloud broker</ul>
</ol></p>

<h1>Cloud Storage Architecture</h1>
<p>Cloud storage is made of distributed resources. It is highly fault tolerant through redundancy, consistent with data replication and highly durable. Widely used object storage services include 
Amazon S3, Oracle Cloud Storage, Microsoft Azure Storage</p>
<h2>Role of AI in Cloud Computing</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Self-managed cloud</ul>
    <ul>Reduced costs</ul>
    <ul>Seamless data access</ul>
    <ul>Improved data management</ul>
    <ul>Increased productivity</ul>
    <ul>Increased reliability</ul>
    <ul>Enhanced experience wit AI-SaaS integration</ul>
    <ul>Availability of advanced cloud infrastructure</ul>
    <ul>Improved cloud security</ul>
    <ul>Better decision making</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Virtual reality and augmented reality on Cloud</h2>
<p>Virtual reality / augmented reality (VR/AR) and cloud computing are two of the most important emerging technologies. When used together, they can create new kinds of applications and usage models.
VR/AR applications demand more digital engine speed than available in the market.</p>
<h2>Fog Computing</h2>
<p>The massive growth in IoT devices worldwide has resulted in the production of an enormous amound of data by these devices. To meet the growing demand for analyzing and processing these data, the 
implementation of fog computing, along with cloud computing, is an ideal solution. Fog computing is a distributed and independent digital environment in which the applications and data storage are 
positioned between data sources (devices generating data) and the cloud service. Fog computing is an extended version of cloud computing that comprises multiple edge nodes that are directly connected to 
physical devices to enable service access to the end users. Generally, fog refers to the idea of creating an individual layer in distributed network infrastructure that has close inter-connections with IoT 
and cloud computing. It acts as an intermediary between hardware and remote servers, and is also called intelligent gateway.</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Low Latency</ul>
    <ul>High business agility</ul>
    <ul>No glitches with bandwidth</ul>
    <ul>No connection loss</ul>
    <ul>Elevated security</ul>
    <ul>Low operation costs</ul>
    <ul>High power efficiency</ul>
</ol></p>

<h1>Edge computing</h1>
<p>Conventional cloud computing has some issues related to data security, low performance and increased data storage which lead to high operational costs. These issues can be solved by replacing conventional 
cloud computing with edge computing. Edge computing is a subset of fog computing and its approach to data processing is similar to that of fog computing. In fog computing, the intelligent gateway performs 
processing at the LAN, whereas in edge computing, the edge gateway intelligence is performed in devices such as programmable automation controllers. Edge computing is a distributed, decentralized computing
model in which computation and data processing are performed close to edge devices.</p>

<h1>Cloud Service Providers</h1>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Amazon Web Service AWS</ul>
    <ul>Microsoft Azure</ul>
    <ul>Google Cloud Platform</ul>
    <ul>IBM Cloud</ul>
</ol></p>

<h1>Container Technology</h1>
<p>Emerging container-based virtualization service. A container is a package of an application/software including all its dependencies, such as library and configuration files, binaries and other resources.
All these resource files are delivered as a unit to solve compatibility issues when applications are moved between cloud environments. These containers are provided to subscribers in the form of a CaaS.
Popular container service include Amazon AWS EC2, Google Kubernetes Engine GKE, Docker etc.</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Portability and consistency</ul>
    <ul>Security</ul>
    <ul>High efficiency and cost effectiveness</ul>
    <ul>Scalability</ul>
    <ul>Robustness</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>To resolve issues of virtualization (slower performance, portability issues etc.) industries are adopting a containerization technology that provides application resources in the form of lightweight 
containers that run on a single operating system and makes the software/application run anywhere with scalable resources. Containers are placed on top of a physical server and host operating system and 
share the system kernel binaries and libraries, reducing the need for reproducing the OS. Virtual Machines are heavyweight, Containers are lightweight and portable. Virtual Machines are hardware based virtualizations. 
Containers are OS based virtualization.</p>

<h2>Docker</h2>
<p>Docker is an open-source technology used for developing, packaging and running applications. All docker dependencies are in the form of containers to ensure that applications work in a seamless environment.
Docker provides a PaaS through OS - level virtualization and delivers containerized software packages. This technology isolates applications from the underlying infrastructure for faster software delivery.
Benefits of Docker is that when an application is packaged along with its dependencies in a Docker container, it can run in any environment.</p>
<p>The Docker engine is a client/server application installed on a host that allows to develop, deploy and run applications using:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Server (daemon process dockerd)</ul>
    <ul>Rest API</ul>
    <ul>Client CLI</ul>
</ol></p>
