<h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
<p>Cloud computing is an emerging technology that delivers computing services, such as online business applications, online data storage and webmail over the internet. The cloud offers benefits but also poses 
many threats and risks to organizations.</p>
<p>Cloud computing is an on-demand delivery of IT capabilities, in which IT infrastructure and applications are provided to subscribers as metered services over networks. </p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>On-demand self-service</ul>
  <ul>Distributed storage</ul>
  <ul>Rapid elasticity</ul>
  <ul>Automated management</ul>
  <ul>Broad network access</ul>
  <ul>Resource pooling</ul>
  <ul>Measured service</ul>
  <ul>Virtualization technology</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Limited control and flexibility of organizations</ul>
  <ul>Proneness to outages and other technical issues</ul>
  <ul>Security, privacy and compliance issues</ul>
  <ul>Contracts and lock-ins</ul>
  <ul>Dependence on network connections</ul>
  <ul>Potential vulnerability to attacks as every component is online</ul>
  <ul>Difficulty in migrating from one service provider to another</ul>
</ol></p>

</ol></p>
<h2>Infrastructure-as-a-Service IaaS</h2>
<p>On-demand fundamental IT resources (computing power, virtualization, data storage, network, virtual machines and other abstracted hardware and OSs</p>
<p>Advantages: dynamic infrastructure scaling, guaranteed uptime, elastic load balancing, global accessability</p>
<p>Disadvantages: software security at high risk (third party providers), performance issues and slow connection speeds</p>
<h2>Platform-as-a-Service PaaS</h2>
<p>Development of applications and services, subscribers need not buy and manage the softwware and infrastructure underneath it, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure</p>
<p>Advantages: simplified deployment, prebuilt business functionality, lower security risks compared to IaaS, instant community, scalable</p>
<p>Disadvantes: vendor lock in, data privacy, integration</p>
<h2>Software-as-a-Service SaaS</h2>
<p>Application software on-demand over the internet, Google Docs, Salesforce CRM</p>
<p>Advantages: low cost, easy administration, global accessability, high compatibility</p>
<p>Disadvantes: security and latency issues, total dependency on the internet, switching between vendors is difficult</p>
<h2>Identity-as-a-Service IDaaS</h2>
<p>Authentication services to subscribed enterprises, it provides services such as Single-Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor-Authentication (MFA), OneLogin, Microsoft Azure Active Directory </p>
<p>Advantages: low cost, improved security, simplify compliance, reduced time, central management of user accounts</p>
<p>Disadvantages: single server failure may disrupt the service or create redundancy on other authentication servers, vulnerable to account hijacking attacks</p>
<h2>Security-as-a-Services SECaaS</h2>
<p>Integrates security services into corporate infrastructure, developed based on SaaS and does not require any physical hardware</p>
<p>Advantages: low cost, reduced complexity, continuous protection, improved security through best security practice, latest and updated security tools, rapid user provisioning, agility</p>
<p>Disadvantages: increased attack surfaces and vulnerabilities, unknown risk profile, insecure APIs, vulnerable to account hijacking attacks</p>
<h2>Container-as-a-Service Caas</h2>
<p>Provides containers and clusters as a service to its subscribers, virtualization of container engines, management of containers, applications and clusters through a web portal or API, 
Amazon EC2, Google Kubernetes Engine GKE</p>
<p>Advantages: streamlined development of containerized applications, pay-per-resource, low cost, few resources, improved security, high scalability</p>
<p>Disadvantages: high operational overhead, platform development is the developer's responsibility</p>
<h2>Function-as-a-Service FaaS</h2>
<p>Platform for developing, running and managing application functionalities, mostly used while developing applications for microservices, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure Functions</p>
<p>Advantages: pay-per-use, low cost, efficient security updates, easy deployment, high scalability</p>
<p>Disadvantages: high latency, memory limitations, monitoring and debugging limitations, unstable tools and framework, vendor lock-in</p>
<h2>Anything-as-a-Service XaaS</h2>
<p>Anything, including digital products such as tools, applications, technologies, food, transportation, medical consults etc., NetApp, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku</p>
<p>Advantages: highly scalable, independent of location and devices, fault tolerance and reduced redundancy, reduced capital expenditure, enhances business process</p>
<p>Disadvantages: chances of service outage as XaaS is dependent on the internet, performance issues, highly complex</p>
<h2>Firewall-as-a-Service FWaaS</h2>
<p>Filtering network traffic, enhanced data analysis capabilities, Zscaler Cloud Firewall, Fortinet, Sophos</p>
<p>Advantages: blocks malicious web traffic, protects multiple cloud deployments, improved network visibility, enhanced reliability, easier maintenance</p>
<p>Disadvantages: resistance to acceptance, network latency issues</p>
<h2>Desktop-as-a-Service DaaS</h2>
<p>Virtual desktops and apps to subscribe, Azure Windows Virtual Desktop, Citrix Managed Desktop</p>
<p>Advantages: global accessability, simplified management, reduced downtime, low cost, high flexibility, high scalability</p>
