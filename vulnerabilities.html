<h1>Vulnerabilities</h1>
<h2>What</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Hardware or software misconfiguration</ul>
  <ul>Insecure or poor design of network and application</ul>
  <ul>Inherent technology weakness</ul>
  <ul>End user carelessness</ul>
  <ul>Intentional end-user acts</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>Vulnerability research is the process of analyzing protocols, services and configurations to discover vulnerabilities and design 
flaws that will expose an operating system and its applications to exploit, attack or misuse.
<ol>
  <ul>Gather information about security trends</ul>
  <ul>Notice newly discovered threats</ul>
  <ul>Attack surfaces, Attack vectors, Techniques</ul>
  <ul>Find weaknesses in the OS and applications</ul>
  <ul>Know how to recover from an attack</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Exploiting</h2>
<p>
  <ol>
    <ul>Identify the vulnerability</ul>
    <ul>Determine the risk associated with the vulnerability</ul>
    <ul>Determine the capability of the vulnerability</ul>
    <ul>Develop the exploit</ul>
    <ul>Select the method for delivering -> local or remote</ul>
    <ul>Generate and deliver the exploit</ul>
    <ul>Gain remote access</ul>
  </ol>
</p>
<h2>Scoring Systems</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Common Vulnerability Scoring System CSVV</ul>
  <ul>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures CVE</ul>
  <ul>National Vulnerability Database NVD</ul>
  <ul>Common Weakness Enumeration CWE</ul>

<h1>Vulnerability Management Life Cycle</h1>
<p>Important process that helps identify and remediate security weaknesses before they can be exploited. </p>
<h2>Pre-Assessment Phase</h2>
<p>
  <ol><ul>prepatory phase, defining policies and standards, clarifying scope of the assessment and creating a <b>good baseline</b> for vulnerability management.</ul>
    <ul>Identify and understand <b>business processes</b></ul>
    <ul>Identify the applications, data and services that support the <b>business processes</b> and perform <b>code reviews</b></ul>
    <ul>Identify the approved software, drivers and basic config for each system</ul>
    <ul>Create an inventory of all assets and prioritize or rank the critical assets</ul>
    <ul>Understand the network architecture and map the network infrastructure</ul>
    <ul>Identify the controls already in place</ul>
    <ul>understand policy implementation and practice standard compliance with <b>business processes</b></ul>
    <ul>Define the scope of the assessment</ul>
    <ul>Create information protection procedures to support effective planning, scheduling, coordination and logistics</ul>
    <ul>Classify the identified assets according to the business needs. <b>Classification</b> helps to identify the high business risks in an organization. Prioritize the rated assets based on the impact of their failure and their reliability in the business.</ul>
    <ul>Prioritization helps:</ul>
    <ul>-> Evaluate and decide a solution for the consequence of the assets failing</ul>
    <ul>-> Examine the risk tolerance level</ul>
    <ul>-> Organize methods for prioritizing the assets</ul>
  </ol>
