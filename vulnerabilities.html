<h1>Vulnerability Management Life Cycle</h1>
<p>Important process that helps identify and remediate security weaknesses before they can be exploited. </p>
<h2>Pre-Assessment Phase</h2>
<p>
  <ol><ul>prepatory phase, defining policies and standards, clarifying scope of the assessment and creating a <b>good baseline</b> for vulnerability management.</ul>
    <ul>Identify and understand <b>business processes</b></ul>
    <ul>Identify the applications, data and services that support the <b>business processes</b> and perform <b>code reviews</b></ul>
    <ul>Identify the approved software, drivers and basic config for each system</ul>
    <ul>Create an inventory of all assets and prioritize or rank the critical assets</ul>
    <ul>Understand the network architecture and map the network infrastructure</ul>
    <ul>Identify the controls already in place</ul>
    <ul>understand policy implementation and practice standard compliance with <b>business processes</b></ul>
    <ul>Define the scope of the assessment</ul>
    <ul>Create information protection procedures to support effective planning, scheduling, coordination and logistics</ul>
    <ul>Classify the identified assets according to the business needs. <b>Classification</b> helps to identify the high business risks in an organization. Prioritize the rated assets based on the impact of their failure and their reliability in the business.</ul>
    <ul>Prioritization helps:</ul>
    <ul>-> Evaluate and decide a solution for the consequence of the assets failing</ul>
    <ul>-> Examine the risk tolerance level</ul>
    <ul>-> Organize methods for prioritizing the assets</ul>
  </ol>
 </p>
<h2>Vulnerability Assessment Phase</h2>
<p>
 <ol>
   <ul>Crucial phase in vulnerability management</ul>
   <ul>Examine and evaluate the physical security</ul>
   <ul>Check for misconfigurations and human errors</ul>
   <ul>Run vulnerability scans using tools</ul>
   <ul>Select the type of scan based on the organization or compliance requirements</ul>
   <ul>Identify and prioritize vulnerabilities</ul>
   <ul>Identify false positives and false negatives</ul>
   <ul>Apply the business and technology context to scanner results</ul>
   <ul>Perform OSINT information gathering to validate the vulnerabilities</ul>
   <ul>Create a vulnerability scan report</ul>
 </ol>
</p>
<h2>Post Assessment Phase</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Recommendation phase</ul>
  <ul>Creating a priority list for assessment recommendations based on the impact analysis</ul>
  <ul>Developing an action plan to implement the proposed remediation</ul>
  <ul>Capturing lessons learned to improve the complete process in the future</ul>
  <ul>Conducting training for employees</ul>
  <ul>Risk Assessment -> risks are identified, characterized and classified along with the techniques used to control or reduce their impact. Risk levels can be high, moderate or low.</ul>
  <ul>Remediation -> applying fixes, based on risk ranking, develop and action plan to implement the remediation, perform root-cause analysis, apply patches and fixes, capture lessons learned, conduct awareness training, perform exception handling and risk acceptance for the vulnerabilities that can not be remediated</ul>
  <ul>Verification -> re-scan of systems to assess if the remediation is complete, verification of remedies, using ticketing systems, scanners and reports</ul>
  <ul>Monitoring -> periodic vulnerability scan and assessment, timely remediation of identified vulnerabilities, monitoring intrusion detection, implementing policies, procedures and controls</ul>
</ol></p>

<h1>Vulnerability Classification and Assessment Types</h1>
<h2>Vulnerability Classification</h2>
<p><b>Misconfigurations / Weak configurations</b>:
<ol>
  <ul>Most common vulnerability, mainly caused by human error</ul>
  <ul>Attackers detect misconfigurations through various scanning techniques</ul>
  <ul>Default configurations of devices have to be changed and optimized</ul>
</ol>
</p>
<h2>Network Misconfigurations</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Frequent changes to network and security devices are inevitable and essential for business improvement</ul>
  <ul>Insecure protocols -> transmitting information or data in plaintext without encryption, use of vulnerable protocols (ftp, telnet etc.)</ul>
  <ul>Open Ports and Services -> Servers often operate with some ports open, but all open ports are not dangerous, unless they are misconfigured, unpatched or implemented with poor security rules. Open ports must be limited. Leaving ports open for unnecessary services can invite new threads to the network, they may lead to the loss of data or DDOS attacks.</ul>
  <ul>Errors -> improper configuration of applications or services can generate error reports, outdated software can also generate security errors, invite code injections. Applications should not disclose critical information that can help attackers.</ul>
  <ul>Weak encryption -> can allow attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks, sniff the traffic, masquerade as legitimate service to communicate with end users with false information, same goes for key generation with guessable credentials, insecure key distribution</ul>
</ol>
</ol></p>
<h2>Host Misconfigurations</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Open Permissions -> granting unnecessary permissions to a user or group can lead to security issues such as data leakage or corruption of system functionality, an attacker can perform privilege escalation by using unnecessarily created accounts to access unprotected files or to run command on the operating system</ul>
  <ul>Unsecured Root Accounts -> using manufacturer-allotted default administrative account credentials can lead to system security issues, attackers can guess the credentials using different brute-force techniques</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Application Flaws</h2>
<p>Application flaws are vulnerabilities in applications that are exploited by attackers. Applications should be secured using the validation and authorization of the user. 
<ol>
  <ul>Buffer Overflows</ul>
  <ul>Memory Leaks</ul>
  <ul>Resource Exhaustion</ul>
  <ul>Integer Overflows</ul>
  <ul>Null Pointer / Object Dereference</ul>
  <ul>DLL Injection</ul>
  <ul>Race Conditions</ul>
  <ul>Time of Check / Time of Use</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Improper Input Handling</h2>
<p>Verification of application functionalities such as validation, filtering, sanitizing, encryption and decryption of INPUT data. Failure in verifying the input data results in vulnerablities. Attackers use techniques such as SQL Injection, cross-site scripting and buffer overflow. </p>
<h2>Improper Error Handling</h2>
<p>An attacker can use error information to exploit a system. Most web applications or server disclose detailed information about errors such as database dumps and stack traces. <b>Fail-open</b> is one of the security issues and defined as the granting of access after a system has failed or denied access.</p>
<h1>Poor Patch Management</h1>
<p>Software vendors provide patches that prevent exploitation and reduce probability of threats. Unpatched software is dangerous. </p>
<h2>Unpatched Servers</h2>
<p>Attackers search for vulnerabilities in servers and exploit them. Unpatched servers use as a hub or an entry point into a network.</p>
<h2>Unpatched firmware</h2>
<p>Firmware vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious code etc. Firmware must regularly be checked and updated.</p>
<h2>Unpatched OS</h2>
<p>Attackers search for systems having unpatched OS and use them for spreading malware to other systems in the network. A vulnerability in an OS can be used to perform privilege escalation using malware that gains sytem- or root-level access. Auto-update feature for OS must be activated.</p>
<h2>Unpatched Applications</h2>
<p>Unpatched application vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject and run malicious code by exploiting a known software bug. No software or application is flawless !</p>
<h1>Design Flaws</h1>
<p>Design flaws are universal to all operating systems and devices. Think of incorrect encryption or poor validation of data. </p>
<h1>Operating System Flaws</h1>
<p>Due to vulnerabilities in OS, applications such as Trojans, Worms and Viruses post threats. Timely patching of the OS, installing minimal sofware applicatinos and using firewall capabilities are essential.</p>
<h1>Third-Party Risks</h1>
<h2>Vendor management</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>selecting suppliers and assess the risks of third-party services and products</ul>
  <ul>System integration -> employing third-party services or hiring third-party vendors to run business operations. Integrators work from inside and can evade firewalls and security solutions, install software, scan ports etc.</ul>
  <ul>Lack of vendor support -> organizations depend on third-party vendors to manage the security of systems inside a network. In such cases vendors are entrusted with discovering and fixing issues. If they have insufficient knowledge, new risks can arise. </ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Supply-chain risks</h2>
<p>The majority of network devices and systems are often purchased from a third party. Software or hardware from a third party may not be properly sanitized and can contain malware.</p>
<h2>Outsourced code development</h2>
<p>Organizations hire contract-based third parties and should establish a secure environment to develop and assess the code being built. The code needs to be securely stored somewhere etc.</p>
<h2>Data storage</h2>
<p>Emerge of cloud technology, vendors may have access to organization data. Data should regularly be checked for security concerns. Data transmission should be performed with encryption and through a secure channel.</p>
<h2>Cloud-based vs. on-premises risks</h2>
<p>Storage and data exposure issues often arise in third-party storage locations. But businesses running in an on-premises environment may also have issues such as weak security configurations, vulnerabilities and vendor issues.</p>
<h1>Default installations / Default configurations</h1>
<p>Default installations are usually user-friendly, especially when being used for the first (installation) time. Failing to change the default settings allows attackers to guess the settings to break into a system. It is important to disable unnecessary components and services associated with the default configuration.</p>
<h1>Default Passwords</h1>
<p>Manufacturers provide users with default passwords to access the device during it's initial setup. Users forget to update the passwords and continue using the default ones.</p>
<h1>Zero-Day Vulnerabilities</h1>
<p>Exposed, but not yet patched ! Major cyber-threat that continuously expose the vulnerable systems until they get patched.</p>
<h1>Legacy Platform Vulnerabilities</h1>
<p>Obsolete and familiar codes and not supported when patching. Legacy systems can be secured using other security controls, for example segregate them from the network so that attackers cannot gain physical access.</p>
<h1>System Sprawl/Undocumenten Assets</h1>
<p>Increased number of systems or server connections without proper documentation or understanding of the maintenance.</p>
<h1>Improper Certificate and Key Management</h1>
<p>Improper certificate and key management may lead to many vulnerabilities that allow attackers to perform password cracking and data exfiltration attacks. Keys stored on servers are vulnerable to attacks. Keys should be stored in an encrypted format and are decrypted only in a protected secure environment. Private keys used with certificates must be stored in a highly secured environment, otherwise an unauthorized individual can intercept the keys and gain access to confidential data or critical systems.</p>
