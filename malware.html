<h1>Malware</h1>
<p>Malicious software that damages or disables computer systems and gives limited or full control of the systems to the malware creator for malicious activities such as theft or fraud. Malware includes viruses, 
worms, Trojans, rootkits, backdoors, botnets, ransomware, spyware, adware, scareware, crapware, roughware, crypters, keyloggers etc.</p>
<p>Malware programmers develop and use malware to:
<ol><ul>Attack browser and track websites visited</ul>
<ul>Slow down systems and degrade system performance</ul>
<ul>Cause hardware failure</ul>
<ul>Steal personal information</ul>
<ul>Erase valuable information</ul>
<ul>Attack additional computer systems</ul>
<ul>Spam inboxes</ul></ol></p>
<h2>How malware enters a system</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul><b>Instant Messenger Applications</b> -> FB messenger, WhatsApp, LinkedIn messenger, ICQ etc. High risk while receiving files via instant messenger. Risk of infection by a Trojan. The user can never be 100% sure of who is at the other end of the connection at any moment. Contact names can be spoofed.</ul>
  <ul><b>Portable Hardware Media/Removable devices</b> -> USB drives, external hard drives etc. Infection by physical access. A USB device with malware can be found or someone can infect your pc when it's unlocked and you are away. The autorun function, also referred to as autoplay or autostart, is a Windows feature that, if enabled, runs an executable </ul>
 <ul><b>Browser and email software bugs</b> -> oudated web browsers / visiting malicious site can automatically infect the machine without downloading / checking e-mail with Outlook Express without downloading an attachment</ul> 
    <ul><b>Insecure patch management</b> -> unpatched software</ul>
    <ul><b>Rogue / Decoy Applications</b> -> downloading free applications / if labeled as TRUSTED protection software like antivirus will fail</ul>
    <ul><b>Untrusted sites and free web applications</b> -> hosted at free website provider</ul>
    <ul><b>Downloading files from internet</b> -> illegal software, movies, greeting cards, screensavers, office files with macros, rtf with macros</ul>
    <ul><b>Email attachments</b> -> most common medium to transmit malware</ul>
    <ul><b>Network propagation</b> -> some malware propagates through technological networks</ul>
    <ul><b>File Sharing</b> -> NetBIOS (port 139), FTP (21), SMB (145) etc.</ul>
    <ul><b>Installation by other malware</b> -> malware installed on one system drives the installation of other malware on the network</ul>
    <ul><b>Bluetooth and Wireless Networks</b> -> installed at router level to capture network traffic as well as find accound details</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Common distribution techniques</h2>
<p><ol>
    <ul>Black hat Search Engine Optimization (SEO) -> Black hat SEO / unethical SEO uses aggressive SEO tactics such as keyword stuffing, inserting doorway pages, page swapping, adding unrelated keywords to get higher search engine rankings</ul>
    <ul>Social Engineered Click-jacking: malware on websites that seem legitimate to trick users into clicking them</ul>
    <ul>Spear-phishing sites: mimicking legitimate institutions like banks, stealing passwords, credit card details etc.</ul>
    <ul>Malvertising: malware laden ads in legitimate online advertising channels</ul>
    <ul>Compromised legitimate websites: compromised websites used to infect systems with malware</ul>
    <ul>Drive-by Downloads: unintentional downloading software by visiting the internet</ul>
    <ul>Spam emails: malicious file in attachment</ul>
    <ul>Rich Text Format (RTF) Injection with macro</ul>
</ol></p>
    <h2>Malware components</h2>
    <p><ol><ul>
        <b>Crypter</b>: software that conceal the existence of malware, elude antivirus detection
    </ul>
    <ul><b>Downloader</b>: type of Trojan that downloads other malware or malicious code and files, usually a downloader is installed after the first access to a system</ul>
        <ul><b>Dropper</b>: covert carrier of malware, can transport malware code and execute malware without being detected by antivirus scanners</ul>
        <ul><b>Exploit</b>: part of the malware that contains code or a sequence of commands that can take advantage of a bug or vulnerability</ul>
        <ul><b>Injector</b>: injects exploits or malicious code into vulnerable running processes and changes the method of execution</ul>
        <ul><b>Obfuscator</b>: conceals the malicious code of malware, making it difficult for security mechanisms to detect or remove</ul>
        <ul><b>Packer</b>: compresses the malware file to convert the code and data of the malware in an unreadable format, compression techniques</ul>
        <ul><b>Payload</b>: performs the desired activity when activated</ul>
        <ul><b>Malicious code</b>: piece of code that defines the basic functionality of the malware and comprises commands that result in security breaches (Java Applets, ActiveX, Browser plug-ins, Pushed content)</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <h2>PUA: Potentially Unwanted Application</h2>
    <p>Most PUAs or PUPs (Potentially Unwanted Program) are known as greyware/junkware and are potentially harmful that may pose severe risks. Most PUAs originate from legitimate sources and get installed with freeware.</p>
