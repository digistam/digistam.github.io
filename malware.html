<h2>How malware enters a system</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Instant Messenger Applications -> FB messenger, WhatsApp, LinkedIn messenger, ICQ etc. High risk while receiving files via instant messenger. Risk of infection by a Trojan. The user can never be 100% sure of who is at the other end of the connection at any moment. Contact names can be spoofed.</ul>
  <ul>Portable Hardware Media/Removable devices -> USB drives, external hard drives etc. Infection by physical access. A USB device with malware can be found or someone can infect your pc when it's unlocked and you are away. The autorun function, also referred to as autoplay or autostart, is a Windows feature that, if enabled, runs an executable </ul>
