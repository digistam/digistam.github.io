<h1>Information Security</h1>
<h2>Elements of information security</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Confidentiality</ul>
  <ul>Integrity</ul>
  <ul>Availability</ul>
  <ul>Authenticity</ul>
  <ul>Non-repudiation</ul>
</ol></p>
  <h2>Motives, goals and objectives of information security attacks</h2>
  <p>Attackers generally have motives (goals) and objectives behind their information security attacks. Once the attacker determines their goal, they can employ various tools, attack techniques and methods 
  to exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system or security policy and controls</p>
  <p><b>Attacks = Motive (Goal) + Method + Vulnerability</b></p>
  <h2>Classification of attacks</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Passive attacks -> footprinting, sniffing, eavesdropping, network traffic analysis, decryption of weakly encrypted traffic</ul>
    <ul>Active attacks -> DoS, bypassing protection mechanisms, malware attacks (virus, worm, ransomware), modification of information, spoofing attacks, replay attacks etc.</ul>
    <ul>Close-in attacks -> social engineering</ul>
    <ul>Insider attacks -> eavesdropping, wiretapping, theft of physical devices, data theft, pod slurping, planting keyloggers, backdoors, malware</ul>
    <ul>Distribution attacks -> tampering with hardware or software prior to installation</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Information Warfare</h2>
  <p>Information warfare (InfoWar): use of information and communication technologies (ICT) for competitive advantages over an opponent</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Command and control warfare (C2 warfare) -> impact an attacker possesses over a compromised system or network that they control</ul>
    <ul>Intelligence based warfare -> sensor-based technology that directly corrupts technological systems</ul>
    <ul>Electronic warfare -> radio electronic and cryptographic techniques to degrade communication</ul>
    <ul>Psychological warfare -> propaganda, terror etc.</ul>
    <ul>Hacker warfare -> all things digital</ul>
    <ul>Economic warfare -> affecting economy </ul>
    <ul>Cyberwarfare -> use of information systems against virtual personas of individuals or groups</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h1>Hacking Methodologies and Frameworks</h1>
  <h2>CEH Hacking Methodology (CHM)</h2>
  <p>EC council's CEH hacking methodology (CHM) defines the step-by-step process to perform ethical hacking. The CHM follows the same process as that of an attacker, and the only differences are in its 
  hacking goals and strategies.</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Footprinting</ul>
    <ul>Scanning -> identify active hosts, open ports and unnecessary services enabled on particular hosts</ul>
    <ul>Enumeration -> making active connections to a target system or subjecting it to direct queries; method of intrusive probing trough which attackers gather information</ul>
    <ul>Vulnerability analysis</ul>
    <ul>System hacking -> gaining access, escalating privileges, maintaining access, clearing logs</ul>
  </ol></p>
<h2>Cyber Kill Chain Methodology</h2>
<p>The cyber kill chain methodology is a framework developed for securing cyberspace based on the concept of military kill chains. This method aims to actively enhance intrusion detection and response. 
The cyber kill chain is equipped with a <b>seven - phase</b> protection mechanism to mitigate and reduce cyber threats.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Reconnaissance -> gather data on the target to probe for weak points</ul>
  <ul>Weaponization -> create a deliverable malicious payload using exploit and backdoor</ul>
  <ul>Delivery -> send weaponized bundle to the victim using email, USB etc.</ul>
  <ul>Exploitation -> exploit a vulnerability by executing code on the victim's system</ul>
  <ul>Installation -> install malware on the target system</ul>
  <ul>Command and Control -> create C2 channel to communicate and pass data back and forth</ul>
  <ul>Actions on Objectives -> perform actions to achieve goals and objectives</ul>
</ol></p>
  <h1>Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)</h1>
  <p>TTP refer to the patterns of activities and methods associated with specific threat actors or groups of threat actors. Organizations should understand TTPs to protect their network against threat actors and 
  upcoming attacks.</p>
  <h2>Tactics</h2>
  <p>Tactics describe the way the threat actor operates during different phases of an attack.</p>
  <h2>Techniques</h2>
  <p>To launch an attack succesfully, threat actors use several techniques during its execution. These techniques include initial exploitation, setting up and maining C2 channels etc. Technique is the set of tools 
  and the way they are used to obtain intermediate results during an attack campaign.</p>
  <h2>Procedures</h2>
  <p>A sequence of actions performed by the threat actors to execute different steps of an <b>attack life cycle</b></p>

  <h1>Adversary Behavioral Identification</h1>
  <p>Adversary behavioral identification involves the identification of the common methods or techniques followed by an adversary to launch attacks to penetrate an organization's network. This gives security 
  professionals insight into upcoming threats and exploits. It helps them plan network security infrastructure and adapt a range of security procedures as prevention against various attacks.</p>
  <h2>Internal Reconnaissance</h2>
  <p>Once the adversary is inside the target network, they follow various techniques and methods to carry out internal reconnaissance. This includes the enumeration of systems, hostss, processes, the execution 
  of various commands to find out information such as the local user context and system configuration, hostname, IP addresses, active remote systems and programs running on the target systems. Security professionals 
  can monitor the activities of an adversary by checking for unusual commands executed in the Batch scripts and PowerShell (LOTL) and by using packet capturing tools.</p>
  <h2>Use of PowerShell</h2>
  <p>POSH can be used by an adversary as a tool for automating data exfiltration and launching further attacks. Check PowerShell transcript logs or Windows Event Logs, user agent string and IP addresses</p>
<h2>Unspecified Proxy Activities</h2>
<p>An adversary can create and configure multiple domains pointing to the same host, allowing to switch quickly between the domains to avoid detection. Security professionals can find unspecified domains by 
checking the data feeds that are generated by those domains. Find any malicious files downloaded and unsolicited communication with the outside network based on the domains</p>
<h2>Use of Command Line Interface</h2>
<p>On gaining access to the target system, ad adversary can make use of the CLI to interact with the target system, browse the files, read file content etc. Check logs for process IDs and malicious files 
downloaded from the Internet</p>
<h2>HTTP User Agent</h2>
<p>In HTTP - based communication, the server identifies the connected HTTP client using the user agent field. An adversary modifies the content of the HTTP user agent field to communicate with the compromised 
system and to carry out further attacks</p>
<h2>Command and Control Server</h2>
<p>Adversaries use command and control servers to communicate remotely with compromised system through an encrypted session. Using the channel an adversary can steal data, delete data and launch further attacks.</p>
<h2>Use of DNS Tunneling</h2>
<p>Adversaries use DNS tunneling to obfuscate malicious traffic in the legitimate traffic carried by common protocols used in the network. Using DNS tunneling, an adversary can also communicate with the command 
and control server, bypass security controls and perform data exfiltration. Security professionals can identify DNS tunneling by analyzing malicious DNS requests, DNS payload, unspecified domains and destination of 
DNS requests</p>
<h2>Use of Web Shell</h2>
<p>Adversaries uses a web shell to manipulate the web server by creating a shell within a website; it allows an adversary to gain remote access to the functionalities of a server. Using a web shell, an adversary 
performs tasks such as data exfiltration, file transfers and file uploads. Security professionals cna identify the web shell running in the network by analyzing server access, error logs, suspicious strings that 
indicate encoding, user agent strings etc.</p>
<h2>Data Staging</h2>
<p>After successful penetration into a target's network, the adversary uses data staging techniques to collect and combine as much data as possible. Security professionals can detect data staging by monitoring
network traffic for malicious file transfers, file integrity monitoring and event logs</p>
<h1>Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)</h1>
<p>IoCs are the clues, artifacts and pieces of forensic data that are found on a network or OS of an organization that indicate a potential intrusion or malicious activity. IoCs are not intelligence, but rather 
a good source of information about threats that serves as data points in the intelligence process. Cybersecurity professionals use various automated tools to monitor IoCs to detect and prevent various security
breaches.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Atomic indicator -> those indicators that can't be segmented into smaller parts and whose meaning is not changed in the context of an intrusion (IP addresses, email addresses)</ul>
  <ul>Computed indicator -> obtained from data extracted from a security incident (hash values, regex values)</ul>
  <ul>Behavioral indicator -> grouping of both atomic and computed indicators, combined on the basis of some logic</ul>
</ol></p>
  <p>IoCs is information regarding suspicious or malicious activities collected from various security establishments in a network's infrastructure.</p>

<h2>Categories of IoC</h2>
<p>The understanding of IoCs helps security professionals quickly detect the threats entering an organization and protect the organization from evolving threats</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Email Indicators</ul>
  <ul>Network Indicators</ul>
  <ul>Host based Indicators</ul>
  <ul>Behavioral Indicators</ul>
</ol></p>
  <h2>Email Indicators</h2>
  <p>Attackers usually prefer email services to send malicious data to the target organization or individual; socially engineered emails are preferred due to their ease of use and anonymity. Email Indicators are 
  sender's email adress, email subject, attachment or hyperlinks</p>
  <h2>Network Indicators</h2>
  <p>Network Indicators are useful for command and control, malware delivery and identifying details about the OS, browser type and other computer specific info. Network Indicators: URLs, domain names, IP addresses</p>
  <h2>Host based Indicators</h2>
  <p>Host based Indicators are found by performing an analysis of the infected system within the organizational network. Host based Indicators: filenames, file hashes, registry keys, DLLs, mutex</p>
  <h2>Behavioral Indicators</h2>
  <p>Behavioral indicators are used to identify specific behavior related to malicious activities such as code injection into the memory or running scripts of an application. Behavioral Indicators: document 
  executing PowerShell script, remote command execution</p>

  <h1>MITRE ATT&CK Framework</h1>
  <p>While the <a href=https://digistam.github.io/threat_intelligence_lifecycle.html>attack life cycle</a> does a good job of describing the process an attacker goes through, it does not describe the 
    specific behaviors used by the attacker, which are called techniques, tactics and procedures (TTP). The MITRE ATT&CK Framework is a taxonomy of TTPs, which means it is a way of organizing TTPs that have been 
    seen in the real world into a set of categories. MITRE ATT&CK is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat 
  models and methodologies in the private sector, government and in the cybersecurity product and service community.</p>
  <p>Following are the stages the ATT&CK Framework identifies:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Reconnaissance -> attacker is looking for victims or ways to get into victim's systems that have been identified</ul>
    <ul>Resource Development -> infrastructure for managing compromised hosts is put together here, as well as developing exploits or collecting credentials from other sources that could be used</ul>
    <ul>Initial Access -> systems or user accounts are compromised to provide the attacker access to a resource that can be used</ul>
    <ul>Execution -> not a stage, but instead describes a series of actions or behaviors an attacker might use to maintain access to a system; this could include execute PowerShell scripts (LOTL) </ul>
    <ul>Persistence -> the attacker needs to ensure they maintain access beyond reboots or other system changes, so they need to be sure they have a program that always runs when the system is started, or at least 
    when a user logs in</ul>
    <ul>Privilege Escalation -> user behavior is restricted, attackers would typically look to gain administrative privileges</ul>
    <ul>Defense Evasion -> businesses do a lot to protect systems, looking for malware and instances of persistence; when attackers try to get access and maintain access regardless of the protection measures in 
    place, it's <b>defense evasion</b> and may include masquerading or execution hijacking or tampering with protections in place</ul>
    <ul>Credential Access -> gathering usernames and password, done either from previous attacks or from systems or users directly; any set of username and password may be useful at some point</ul>
    <ul>Discovery -> any activity that collects information within the victim environment could be considered discovery</ul>
    <ul>Lateral Movement -> attackers will generally move from one system to another within the victim environment, to collect more information or to gather details about systems or users that could be used 
    elsewhere</ul>
    <ul>Collection -> once the attacker has found information they want to use or sell, they need to pull it together; staging the data</ul>
    <ul>Command and Control -> the attacker needs a way of getting remote access to systems or to send commands to those systems; usually, there is infrastructure in place to perform this command and control 
    work; because of firewalls direct access to victim systems is not possible so the connection needs to be initiated from the inside of the network</ul>
    <ul>Exfiltration -> collected data needs to be moved out to the attacker locations so it can be dealt with; moving the data out of the target environment to the attacker's place is exfiltration</ul>
    <ul>Impact -> attackers are not always looking to steal information; sometimes they are destructive or they modify data by encryption so victim's can't get access (ransomware)</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <p>The MITRE ATT&CK Framework continues to be updated with new TTPs as they are discovered</p>
  <h1>Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis</h1>
  <p>The Diamond Model, developed by expert analysts, introduces state-of-the-art technology for intrusion analysis. This model offers a framework and a set of procedures for recognizing clusters of events that 
  are correlated on any of the systems in an organization. With the Diamond Model, more advanced and efficient mitigation approaches can be developed and analytic efficiency can be increased. The Diamond Model 
  consists of four basic features:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Adversary</ul>
    <ul>Capability</ul>
    <ul>Infrastructure</ul>
    <ul>Victim</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Adversary</h2>
  <p>Refers to opponent or hacker responsible for the attack event. An adversary takes advantage of a <b>capability</b> against the <b>victim</b> to perform a malicious activity for financial benefit or damage. 
  Adversaries can be insiders or competitor organizations.</p>
  <h2>Victim</h2>
  <p>The victim is the target that has been exploited or the environment where the attack was performed. The <b>adversary</b> exploits the vulnerabilities or security loopholes in the victim's <b>infrastructure</b>
  by using their resources. The victim can be any person, organization, institution or even network information such as IP addresses, domain names, email addresses and sensitive personal information of an individual.</p>
  <h2>Capability</h2>
  <p>Refers to all the strategies, methods and procedures associated with an attack. It can also be a malware or tool used against the target. Capability includes simple and complex attack techniques such as brute 
  forcing and ransomware attacks.</p>
  <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
  <p>Refers to hardware or software used in the network by the target that has a connection with the <b>adversary</b>. It refers to <b>What</b> the adversary has used to reach the victim.</p>
