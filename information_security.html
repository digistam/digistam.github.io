<h1>Information Security</h1>
<h2>Elements of information security</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Confidentiality</ul>
  <ul>Integrity</ul>
  <ul>Availability</ul>
  <ul>Authenticity</ul>
  <ul>Non-repudiation</ul>
</ol></p>
  <h2>Motives, goals and objectives of information security attacks</h2>
  <p>Attackers generally have motives (goals) and objectives behind their information security attacks. Once the attacker determines their goal, they can employ various tools, attack techniques and methods 
  to exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system or security policy and controls</p>
  <p><b>Attacks = Motive (Goal) + Method + Vulnerability</b></p>
  <h2>Classification of attacks</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Passive attacks -> footprinting, sniffing, eavesdropping, network traffic analysis, decryption of weakly encrypted traffic</ul>
    <ul>Active attacks -> DoS, bypassing protection mechanisms, malware attacks (virus, worm, ransomware), modification of information, spoofing attacks, replay attacks etc.</ul>
    <ul>Close-in attacks -> social engineering</ul>
    <ul>Insider attacks -> eavesdropping, wiretapping, theft of physical devices, data theft, pod slurping, planting keyloggers, backdoors, malware</ul>
    <ul>Distribution attacks -> tampering with hardware or software prior to installation</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Information Warfare</h2>
  <p>Information warfare (InfoWar): use of information and communication technologies (ICT) for competitive advantages over an opponent</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Command and control warfare (C2 warfare) -> impact an attacker possesses over a compromised system or network that they control</ul>
  </ol></p>
