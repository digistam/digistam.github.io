<h1>Information Security</h1>
<h2>Elements of information security</h2>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Confidentiality</ul>
  <ul>Integrity</ul>
  <ul>Availability</ul>
  <ul>Authenticity</ul>
  <ul>Non-repudiation</ul>
</ol></p>
  <h2>Motives, goals and objectives of information security attacks</h2>
  <p>Attackers generally have motives (goals) and objectives behind their information security attacks. Once the attacker determines their goal, they can employ various tools, attack techniques and methods 
  to exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system or security policy and controls</p>
  <p><b>Attacks = Motive (Goal) + Method + Vulnerability</b></p>
  <h2>Classification of attacks</h2>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Passive attacks -> footprinting, sniffing, eavesdropping, network traffic analysis, decryption of weakly encrypted traffic</ul>
    <ul>Active attacks -> DoS, bypassing protection mechanisms, malware attacks (virus, worm, ransomware), modification of information, spoofing attacks, replay attacks etc.</ul>
    <ul>Close-in attacks -> social engineering</ul>
    <ul>Insider attacks -> eavesdropping, wiretapping, theft of physical devices, data theft, pod slurping, planting keyloggers, backdoors, malware</ul>
    <ul>Distribution attacks -> tampering with hardware or software prior to installation</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Information Warfare</h2>
  <p>Information warfare (InfoWar): use of information and communication technologies (ICT) for competitive advantages over an opponent</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Command and control warfare (C2 warfare) -> impact an attacker possesses over a compromised system or network that they control</ul>
    <ul>Intelligence based warfare -> sensor-based technology that directly corrupts technological systems</ul>
    <ul>Electronic warfare -> radio electronic and cryptographic techniques to degrade communication</ul>
    <ul>Psychological warfare -> propaganda, terror etc.</ul>
    <ul>Hacker warfare -> all things digital</ul>
    <ul>Economic warfare -> affecting economy </ul>
    <ul>Cyberwarfare -> use of information systems against virtual personas of individuals or groups</ul>
  </ol></p>
  <h1>Hacking Methodologies and Frameworks</h1>
  <h2>CEH Hacking Methodology (CHM)</h2>
  <p>EC council's CEH hacking methodology (CHM) defines the step-by-step process to perform ethical hacking. The CHM follows the same process as that of an attacker, and the only differences are in its 
  hacking goals and strategies.</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Footprinting</ul>
    <ul>Scanning -> identify active hosts, open ports and unnecessary services enabled on particular hosts</ul>
    <ul>Enumeration -> making active connections to a target system or subjecting it to direct queries; method of intrusive probing trough which attackers gather information</ul>
    <ul>Vulnerability analysis</ul>
    <ul>System hacking -> gaining access, escalating privileges, maintaining access, clearing logs</ul>
  </ol></p>
<h2>Cyber Kill Chain Methodology</h2>
<p>The cyber kill chain methodology is a framework developed for securing cyberspace based on the concept of military kill chains. This method aims to actively enhance intrusion detection and response. 
The cyber kill chain is equipped with a <b>seven - phase</b> protection mechanism to mitigate and reduce cyber threats.</p>
<p><ol>
  <ul>Reconnaissance</ul>
  <ul>Weaponization</ul>
  <ul>Delivery</ul>
  <ul>Exploitation</ul>
  <ul>Installation</ul>
  <ul>Command and Control</ul>
  <ul>Actions on Objectives</ul>
</ol></p>
  <h1>Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)</h1>
  <p>TTP refer to the patterns of activities and methods associated with specific threat actors or groups of threat actors. Organizations should understand TTPs to protect their network against threat actors and 
  upcoming attacks.</p>
  <h2>Tactics</h2>
  <p>Tactics describe the way the threat actor operates during different phases of an attack.</p>
  <h2>Techniques</h2>
  <p>To launch an attack succesfully, threat actors use several techniques during its execution. These techniques include initial exploitation, setting up and maining C2 channels etc. Technique is the set of tools 
  and the way they are used to obtain intermediate results during an attack campaign.</p>
