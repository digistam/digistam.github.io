<h1><b>Nmap commands</b></h1>
    <h2>Least intrusive: List Scan</h2>
    <p>The list scan -sL is a degenerate form of host discovery that simply lists each host of the network(s) specified, without sending any packets to the 
        target hosts. All it does is running through all the IP addresses in the block (/24). It doesn't do a lot but by default, 
        Nmap still does reverse-<b>DNS resolution</b> on the hosts to learn their names. It is often surprising how much useful information 
        simple hostnames give out. The list scan is a good sanity check to ensure that you have proper IP addresses for your targets. 
        If the hosts sport domain names you do not 
        recognize, it is worth investigating further to prevent scanning the wrong company's network. Since the idea is to simply <b>print a list of target hosts</b>, 
        options for higher level functionality such as port scanning, OS detection, or host discovery cannot be combined with this. 
        If you wish to disable host discovery while still performing such higher level functionality, read up on the -Pn (skip host discovery) option.</p> 
    <p><b>sudo nmap -sL 192.168.2.243/24</b></p>
    <h2>No Port Scan [Ping Sweep]</h2>
<p>This option tells Nmap not to do a port scan after host discovery, and only print out the available hosts that responded to the host discovery probes. 
    This is often known as a <b>ping scan</b>, but you can also request that traceroute and NSE host scripts be run. This is by default one step more 
    intrusive than the list scan, and can often be used for the same purposes. It allows light reconnaissance of a target network without attracting much 
    attention. Knowing how many hosts are up is more valuable to attackers than the list provided by list scan of every single IP and host name.
    This is often called a <b>ping sweep</b>, and is more reliable than pinging the broadcast address because many hosts do not reply to broadcast queries.
    The default host discovery done with -sn consists of an ICMP echo request, TCP SYN to port 443, TCP ACK to port 80, and an ICMP timestamp request by default. 
    When executed by an unprivileged user, only SYN packets are sent (using a connect call) to ports 80 and 443 on the target. In previous releases of Nmap, 
    -sn was known as -sP. However, <b>Metasploit still uses the -sP parameter for ping sweep !</b></p>
    <p>The difference between de List scan (-sL) and the Ping sweep (-sn) is that with the Ping sweep nmap shows which hosts are UP!</p>
    <p><b>sudo nmap -sn 192.168.2.254/24</b></p>
    <p>ZenMap will create a nice list of detected IP addresses with their MAC addresses. The no port scan with the <b>-sn</b> flag is used as a basis parameter for Ping scans!</p>
    <h2>PING scans</h2>
    <p>Ping scans are defined with the <b>-Px</b> flag!</p>
        <h2>[ARP] ARP ping scan</h2>
    <p>ARP ping scan scan uses the -PR parameter. The ARP ping scan probes ARP request to target the host; an ARP response means that the host is active</p>
    <p><b>sudo nmap -sn -PR 10.10.1.22</b></p>
    <h2>[UDP] UDP ping scan</h2>
    <p>The UDP ping scan (-PU) sends UDP packets to the target host; a UDP response means that the host is active. If the target host is offline or unreachable, various error messages 
    such as "host/network unreachable" or "TTL exceeded" could be returned</p>
    <p><b>sudo nmap -sn -PU 10.10.1.22</b></p>
    <h2>[ICMP] ICMP ECHO ping scan</h2>
    <p>The ICMP ECHO ping scan involves sending ICMP ECHO requests to a host. If the target host is alive, it will return an ICMP ECHO reply. This scan is useful for locating active
    devices or determining if the ICMP is passing through a firewall</p>
    <p><b>sudo nmap -sn -PE 10.10.1.22</b></p>
    <h2>[ICMP] ICMP ECHO ping sweep</h2>
    <p>An ICMP ECHO ping sweep discovers live hosts from a range of target IP addresses. If a host is alive, it will return an ICMP ECHO reply.</p>
    <p><b>sudo nmap -sn -PE 10.10.1.10-23</b></p>
    <h2>[ICMP] ICMP timestamp ping</h2>
    <p>ICMP timestamp ping is an optional and additional type of ICMP ping whereby attackers query a timestamp message to acquire the information related to the current time from the host</p>
    <p><b>sudo nmap -sn -PP 10.10.1.22</b></p>
    <h2>[ICMP] ICMP Address Mask Ping Scan</h2>
    <p>This technique is an alternative for the traditional ICMP ECHO ping scan specifically when administrators block the ICMP ECHO pings</p>
    <p><b>sudo nmap -sn -PM 10.10.1.10</b></p>
    <h2>[TCP] SYN Ping Scan</h2>
    <p>This technique sends empty TCP SYN packets to the target host, ACK response means that the host is active</p>
    <p><b>sudo nmap -sn -PS 10.10.1.10</b></p>
    <h2>[TCP] ACK Ping Scan</h2>
    <p>This technique sends empty TCP ACK packets to the target host, RST response means that the host is active</p>
    <p><b>sudo nmap -sn -PA 10.10.1.10</b></p>
    <h2>[IP] IP Protocol Ping Scan</h2>
    <p>This technique sends different probe packets of different IP protocols to the target host, any response from any probe indicates that a host is active</p>
    <p><b>sudo nmap -sn -PO 10.10.1.10</b></p>
    <h1>TCP scans (Port scans)</h1>
    <p>Tip: scanning port ranges with nmap can be slow and take a long while. It can be wise to use <b>masscan</b> for scannning port ranges and nmap for scanning single hosts! We can also use the <b>-v</b> flag 
    (verbose) which is a progress indicator. Also, in stead of checking the top 1000 ports we can check the top 100 ports using the <b>-F</b> flag.</p>
    <p>Port scans are defined with the <b>-sX</b> flag!</p>
    <p>We can do TCP scans as well as UDP scans with nmap</p>
<h2>[TCP] SYN scan (half-open scan)</h2>
<p>This is called the half-open scan or stealth scan because connections are left half open (handshake will not be completed). Nmap will send a SYN message to the target. If the port is open, it will respond with SYN/ACK messagen. 
Nmap will respond to that with a RST message, indicating it doesn't want to continue with the connection. If the port is closed, the target will respond with RST. A SYN scan has the parameter -sS. The stealth scan involves 
resetting the TCP connection between the client and server abruptly before completion of the 3-way handshake signals, and hence leaving the connection half-open. This scanning technique can be used to bypass firewall rules, 
logging mechanisms, and hide under network traffic.</p>
<p><b>sudo nmap -sS 192.168.86.32</b></p>
<h2>Full connect scan</h2>
<p>In a full connect scan, nmap completes the 3-way handshake. Once the handshake is completed, the client sends an RST packet to end the connection. It can be used to demonstrate the use of a network block as a target. 
    A full connect scan has the parameter -sT. Scanning with this parameter can take a while. It's best to limit scanning to some interesting ports otherwise it will take ages to complete scanning thousands of ports. 
    In a standard situation, nmap checks the top 1000 ports. In order to limit this we can use the <b>-F</b> flag so nmap will check the top 100 ports.</p>
<p><b>sudo nmap -sT -F 192.168.86.0/24</b></p>
    <h2>[TCP] ACK scan</h2>
    <p>The ACK flag -sA sends an ACK probe packet with a random sequence number; no response implies that the port is filtered (stateful firewall), and an RST response means that the port is not filtered.</p>
    <p><b>sudo nmap -sA -v 192.168.0.216</b></p>
    <h2>[TCP] Other scans</h2>
    <p>There are additional TCP scans that nmap run. The other scans make use of <b>unexpected</b> input as a way of potentially getting different responses. </p>
<p>The NULL, FIN and Xmas scan types (even more are possible with the --scanflags option) exploit a 
    subtle loophole in the TCP RFC to differentiate between open and closed ports. Page 65 of RFC 793 says that 
    <i>“if the [destination] port state is CLOSED .... an incoming segment not containing a RST causes a RST to be sent in response.”</i> 
    Then the next page discusses packets sent to open ports without the SYN, RST, or ACK bits set, stating that: 
    <i>“you are unlikely to get here, but if you do, drop the segment, and return.”</i>
When scanning systems compliant with this RFC text, any packet not containing SYN, RST, or ACK bits will result in a <b>returned RST</b> if the port is 
    closed and <b>no response</b> at all if the port is open. As long as none of those three bits are included, any combination of the other three 
    (FIN, PSH, and URG) are OK.</p>
<h2>[TCP] Xmas scan</h2>
<p>Xmas scan sends a TCP frame to a target system with FIN, URG and PUSH flags set. If the target has opened the port, then you will receive no response from the target system. If the target has closed the port, then
    you will receive a target system reply with an RST. It is named Xmas scan because the packages being sent have the FIN, PSH and URG flags set (leaving out SYN, RST or ACK), which makes the packet look lit up like 
    a Christmas tree. What we will see is that we don't get an indication about open ports here. Instead, nmap is telling us that the port is either <b>open</b> or <b>filtered</b>. The reason for this is that with ports 
    that are closed, the system responds with a RST. Ports that are open don't respond at all because it is not a legal packet from the perspective of the protocol. If nmap doesn't get any response, it's not clear 
    whether it's because a network device dropped the message or if they system just didn't respond to an illegal message. If the scan results show that the ports are open / filtered on the target machine, it means 
that a firewall has been configured on the target machine.</p>
<p><b>sudo nmap -sX 192.168.86.32</b></p>
    <h2>[TCP] Maimon scan</h2>
    <p>In the TCP Maimon scan, a FIN / ACK probe is sent to the target; if there is no response, then the port is Open / Filtered, but if the RST packet is sent as a response, then the port is closed.</p>
    <h2>[TCP] Null scan</h2>
<p>Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0)</p>
<h2>[TCP] FIN scan</h2>
    <p>Sets just the TCP <b>FIN</b> bit</p>
    <p>These three scan types are exactly the same in behavior except for the TCP flags set in probe packets</p>

    <h2>Sneak through Firewalls and IDSs</h2>
    <p>The key advantage to the FIN, NULL and Xmas scan types is that they can sneak through certain non-stateful firewalls and packet filtering routers. 
        Such firewalls try to prevent incoming TCP connections (while allowing outbound ones) by blocking any TCP packets with the SYN bit set and ACK cleared. 
        The NULL, FIN, and Xmas scans <b>clear the SYN bit</b> and thus fly right through those rules.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that these scan types are a <b>little more stealthy</b> than even a SYN scan. 
    Don't count on this though—most modern IDS products can be configured to detect them. </p>

<h2>UDP scans</h2>
<p>UDP scanning is much more straigthforward than TCP scanning. There are NO options for UDP scanning. Nmap sends out UDP messages and then watches whatever responses may come back. The expectation is that if a 
port is closed, the system will respond with an ICMP portunreachable message. If the port is open, the service may respond with something or <b>it may not respond at all</b>. The UDP scan uses UDP protocol 
instead of the TCP. There is no 3-way handshake for the UDP scan. It sends UDP packets to the target host; no response means that the port is open. If the port is closed, an ICMP port unreachable message is
received. This scan will take approximately 20 minutes to finish.</p>
<p><b>sudo nmap -sU -v 192.168.86.32</b></p>
<p>Notice that UDP scans may take much longer time than TCP scans. It's possible to use the -T parameter, which sets the throttle rate. By default, the throttle rate is set at 3, which is a common rate of 
message transmission. If you want it faster, you can go up to 5.</p>
<h2>NOT all available ports!</h2>
<p>Be aware that nmap will not show all available open ports. In order to scan all 65535 ports we can use the following:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>sudo masscan -sS --ports 0-65535 192.168.1.216</ul>
    <ul>sudo masscan -sU --ports 0-65535 192.168.1.216</ul>
</ol></p>
<h1>Evasion with nmap</h1>
<p>Any target organization you test against will have security mechanisms in place to defend itself. It may be firewalls, IDS systems or IPS systems. Any of these could block scan attempts or issue an alert, 
which may lead to discovery of your actions. This is why you need to think about evasion techniques. To some degree, nmap has its own evasion techniques built in. One of them is the Idle scan, using a zombie 
system. Another way is to "blind" the defender with using a number of decoys. You can have nmap create a diversion by generating a lot of bogus traffic alongside the port scans you actually care about. This is 
done with the -D flag along with decoy parameters. It's easy to let nmap randomize the source addresses:</p>
<p><ol>
    <ul>sudo nmap -D rnd:3 192.168.178.1</ul>
</ol></p>
    <p>On top of creating decoys, you can have nmap take care of fragmentation for you. The <b>-f</b> flag is used for this. While fragroute is good and can be used across many different circumstances, 
        having nmap take care of fragmentation is easy, if all you need to do is scan:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>sudo nmap -f -p 80,443,445 192.168.1.1</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>Another way is to have nmap set the MTU. The MTU is a field in the IP header that tells the network equipment how large the IP packets can be based on the transmission medium. Some networks will 
    only accept data frames of a limited size. Ethernet, for example, allows a maximum transmission unit of 1500 bytes. Any data larger than that needs to be fragmented, with the fragmentation headers 
    set appropriately. It is up to the receiving party to put the complete message back together in the right order. If you set the MTU small enough, some intermediate devices like routers or firewalls 
    MAY opt to send the messages on rather than reconstructing to review. Letting nmap set the MTU looks like this, keeping in mind that the MTU needs to be a multiple of 8</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>sudo nmap -f -p 80,443 192.168.1.1</ul>
        <ul>sudo nmap --mtu 24 -p 80,443 192.168.1.1</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>Additional techniques include spoofing of the originating MAC address. It's used to take advantage of a trust relationship in the firewall on the local network, trusting a specific MAC address. This 
    doesn't work if the target is remote. The first time your frame hits a network device, like a router or firewall, the frame's header incl. the MAC address will be removed, only to be replaced by 
    the appropriate MAC address on the other side of the firewall or router</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>sudo nmap --spoof-mac 00:00:00:00:00:FF -p 80 192.168.1.1</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>Finally, you can spoof the source port. Some firewalls look at the source port because it's necessary for some applications, like DNS or FTP. You could use:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>sudo nmap -g 53 -p 80 192.168.1.1</ul>
        <ul>here nmap sends traffic from a source port of 53, suggesting it is DNS related</ul>
    </ol></p>
<h1>Service version detection</h1>
<p>Service version detection helps us to obtain information about the running services and their versions on a target system. Obtaining an accurate service version number allows us to determine which 
exploits the target system is vulnerable to.</p>
<p><b>sudo nmap -sV 10.10.1.22</b></p>
<h2>Aggressive scan</h2>
<p>The <b>-A</b> flag enables aggressive scan. The aggressive scan options supports OS detection (-O), version scanning (-sV), script scanning (-sC) and traceroute (--traceroute). You should NOT use -A 
agains target networks without permission ! We can use a wildcard in the IP range in order to scan a whole subnet:</p>
<p><b>sudo nmap -A -v 10.10.1.*</b></p>
