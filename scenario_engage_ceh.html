<h1>Lab: Security Audit</h1>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>You have been hired as a part of the Red Team at CEHORG, an IT and ITES organization that deals with advanced research and development in the field of 
information security. It has offices all over the country connected in real-time by its network infrastructure. Your organization is worried about rising 
cybersecurity incidents and has entrusted you with a comprehensive security audit of the complete infrastructure. </p>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p>CEHORG’s internal network consists of <b>several subnets</b> housing various organizational units like any large organization. The front office is connected 
to a <b>separate subnet</b> that connects to the company’s public-facing computers. The company has installed multiple kiosks to help customers understand their 
products and services. The front office also has <b>Wi-Fi connectivity</b> to cater to the users who carry their smartphones and laptops.</p>
<p>The CEHORG’s internal network is made up of <b>Militarized and Demilitarized zones</b>. As a security precaution, and by design, all the internal resource 
zones are configured with <b>different subnet IPs</b>. The militarized zone houses the application servers that provide application frameworks for various 
departments. The Demilitarized Zone contains public-facing systems of the organization, such as web and mail servers. The headquarter’s network topology and 
protocols are <b>replicated</b> worldwide in all its satellite offices for easy communication with the headquarters.</p>

<h2>Inventory</h2>
<p>On the cyber range, you will have access to Ethical Hacker Workstations, EH Workstation – 1 and EH Workstation – 2. EH Workstation – 1 is a Windows 11 
machine and EH Workstation – 2 is a Parrot Security machine. You can switch to these machines from the Resources tab.</p>
<p>The credentials to access EH Workstation – 1 (Windows 11) machine are: Username: Admin Password: Pa$$w0rd</p>
<p>The credentials to access EH Workstation – 2 (Parrot Security) are: Username: attacker Password: toor</p>
<p>The credentials to access OpenVAS on EH Workstation – 1 (Parrot Security) machine are: Username: admin Password: password</p>
<p>You can use username.txt and password.txt available on the Desktop of the EH Workstation – 2 (Parrot Security) machine for any <b>credentials/password 
cracking</b> attempt.</p>

<h1>CEH Engage - Part I</h1>
<p>Part 1 of CEH Engage covers Footprinting and Reconnaissance, Scanning Networks, Enumeration, and Vulnerability Analysis modules. In this part, you are 
required to perform passive and active reconnaissance of the target organization, enumerating services, shares, users, user groups, etc., and perform 
vulnerability analysis of the identified systems/networks on the target. You need to note all the information discovered in this part of the CEH Engage and 
proceed to the subsequent phases of the ethical hacking cycle in the next part of the CEH Engage.</p>
<h2>Flags</h2>
<p>Challenge 1:</p>
<p>An attacker conducted footprinting on a web application and saved the resulting report Dumpster.xlsx in the documents folder of EH Workstation-1. 
Your task is to analyze this report and identify the hostname associated with the IP address 173.245.59.176. (Format: aaaaa.aa.aaaaaaaaaa.aaa)</p>
<p>Answer: henry.ns.cloudflare.com</p>
<p>Challenge 2:</p>
<p>Identify the number of live machines in <b>192.168.10.0/24</b> subnet. (Format: N)</p>
<p>Answer: we can do this task from Workstation 1 as ZenMap is installed. What's the best method to scan for live hosts in a subnet ? ARP should be the answer.
One of the <b>most common Nmap usage scenarios</b> is to scan an ethernet LAN. On most LANs, especially those using private address ranges granted by RFC 1918, 
    the vast majority of IP addresses are unused at any given time. When Nmap tries to send a raw IP packet such as an ICMP echo request, the operating system 
    must determine the destination hardware (ARP) address corresponding to the target IP so that it can address the ethernet frame properly. This requires it 
    to issue a series of ARP requests.</p>
<p><ol>
<ul>nmap -sP -PR 192.168.10.0/24</ul>
<ul>6 hosts are up</p>
<ul>Nmap tells us -PR is deprecated and ARP is used when possible. It also is clear -sP is replaced by -sn, so:</ul>
<ul><b>nmap -sn 192.168.10.0/24</b> is the most modern command to print out the available hosts that responded to the host discovery probes</ul>
<ul>Tip: -sn can be remembered as "serial number"</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Challenge 3:</p>
<p>Identify the IP address of a Linux-based machine with port 22 open in the target network 192.168.10.0/24 (Format: NNN.NNN.NN.NNN).</p>
<p>Answer:<p>
<p><ol>
<ul>nmap -sV -p 22 192.168.10.0/24</ul>
<ul>192.168.10.101 has port 22 open with OpenSSH for_Windows_8.1</ul>
<ul>192.168.10.111 has port 22 open with OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu</ul>
<ul>192.168.10.111 is Linux based and the right answer</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Challenge 4:</p>
<p>Find the IP address of the Domain Controller machine in <b>192.168.0.0/24</b>. (Format: NNN.NNN.NN.NNN)</p>
<p>Tip: for any exercise <b>read the IP address</b> and don't make mistakes !</p>
<p><ol>
<ul>Very important to remember is the Domain Controllers use <b>port 389</b> (ldap)</ul>
<ul>nmap -sV -p 389 192.168.0.0/24</ul>
<ul>192.168.0.222 has open port 389</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Challenge 5:</p>
<p>Perform a host discovery scanning and identify the NetBIOS_Domain_Name of the host at 192.168.0.222. (Format: AAAAA.AAA)</p>
<p><ol>
<ul>nmap -sV -O 192.168.0.222</ul>
<ul>NetBIOS_Domain_Name is SKILL.CEH</ul>
<ul>It is also possible to use the -A parameter:</ul>
<ul>nmap -A 192.168.0.222</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Challenge 6:</p>
<p>Perform an <b>intense scan</b> on 192.168.0.222 and find out the DNS_Tree_Name of the machine in the network. (Format: AAAAA.AAA.aaa)</p>
<p><ol>
<ul>Remeber: an intense scan uses the -A parameter</ul>
<ul>nmap -A 192.168.0.222</ul>
<ul>DNS_Tree_Name is SKILL.CEH.com</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Challenge 7:</p>
<p>While performing a security assessment against the CEHORG network, you came to know that one machine in the network is running OpenSSH 
and is vulnerable. Identify the version of the OpenSSH running on the machine. Note: Target network 192.168.10.0/24. (Format: N.NaN)</p>
<p>Answer: earlier in challenge 3 we found out that 192.168.10.111 has OpenSSH 8.9p1 installed, so the answer here is 8.9p1</p>
<p>Challenge 8:</p>
<p>During a security assessment, it was found that a server was hosting a website that was susceptible to blind SQL injection attacks. 
Further investigation revealed that the underlying database management system of the site was MySQL. Determine the machine OS that hosted the database. 
Note: Target network 172.30.10.0/24 (Format: Aaaaaa)</p>
<p>Answer: it's important to remember that MySQL makes us of port 3306</p>
<p><ol>
<ul>nmap -sV -p 3306 172.30.10.0/24</ul>
<ul>172.30.10.99 has open port 3306</ul>
<ul>nmap -A 172.30.10.99</ul>
<ul>Running: Ubuntu</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Challenge 9:</p>
<p>Perform an intense scan on target subnet 192.168.10.0/24 and determine the IP address of the machine hosting the MSSQL database service. 
(Format: NNN.NNN.NN.NNN)</p>
<p>Answer: a lot of times MSSQL makes use of port 1433, but this is not always the case so we have to use a broader approach</p>
<p><ol>
<ul>nmap -sS -T4 192.168.10.0/24</ul>
<ul>192.168.10.144 has open port 1433 with service ms-sql-s</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Challenge 10:</p>
<p>Perform a DNS enumeration on www.certifiedhacker.com and find out the name servers used by the domain. (Format: aaN.aaaaaaaa.aaa, aaN.aaaaaaaa.aaa)</p>
<p>Answer: nobody said we have to use nmap for this, so we use nslookup which is maybe a better choice</p>
<p><ol>
<ul>nslookup</ul>
<ul>set type=ns</ul>
<ul>www.certifiedhacker.com</ul>
<ul>ns1.bluehost.com, ns2.bluehost.com</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Challenge 11:</p>
<p>Find the IP address of the machine running SMTP service on the 172.30.10.0/24 network. (Format: NNN.NN.NN.NNN)</p>
<p>Answer: important to understand that SMTP makes use of port 25</p>
<p><ol>
<ul>nmap -sV -p 25 172.30.10.0/24</ul>
<ul>172.30.10.200 has open port 25 with service Microsoft ESMTP</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Challenge 12:</p>
<p>Perform an SMB Enumeration on 172.30.10.200 and check whether the Message signing feature is required. Give your response as Yes/No.</p>
<p>Answer: for this challenge we need to use an nmap script</p>
<p><ol>
<ul>nmap --script-help *smb*</ul>
<ul>script smb2-security-mode determines the message signing configuration</ul>
<ul>nmap --script smb2-security-mode.nse 172.30.10.200</ul>
<ul>Message signing enable but not required</ul>
<ul>There's a trick: if you don't know the right name of the script, you can use the asterisk as wildcard:</ul>
<ul>nmap --script *smb*security* 172.30.10.200</ul>
</ol></p>
<p>Challenge 13:</p>
<p>Perform a vulnerability assessment on the 2023 CWE Top 25 most dangerous software vulnerabilities and determine the weakness ID of the last entry on the list. 
(Format: NNN)</p>
<p>Answer: visit https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2023/2023_top25_list.html. The answer is 276</p>
<p>Challenge 14:</p>
<p>Perform vulnerability scanning for the Linux host in the 192.168.10.0/24 network using OpenVAS and find the QoD percentage of vulnerabilitiy with 
severity level as medium. (Format: NN)</p>
<p>Answer: to do this task we have to know that in the CEH course OpenVAS is used as docker. The command to start this is:<br/>
docker run -d -p 443:443 --name openvas mikesplain/openvas</p>
<p><ol>
<ul>Go to Workstation - 2</ul>
<ul>Start terminal</ul>
<ul>docker run -d -p 443:443 --name openvas mikesplain/openvas</ul>
<ul>Start Firefox and open 127.0.0.1</ul>
<ul>Log in with admin:admin</ul>
<ul>We have to scan the Linux host in 192.168.10.0/24 and earlier, in challenge 3, we found out that this is 192.168.10.111</ul>
<ul>In OpenVAS we create a new task for this scan</ul>
<ul>Scans -> Task -> Task Wizard -> 192.168.10.111</ul>
<ul>Now we wait for the scan to complete</ul>
<ul>The answer is 70% QOD (FTP Unencrypted Cleartext Login)
</ol></p>
<p>Challenge 15:</p>
<p>Perform a vulnerability scan on the host at 192.168.10.144 using OpenVAS and identify any FTP-related vulnerability. (Format: AAA Aaaaaaaaa Aaaaaaaaa Aaaaa )</p>
<p><ol>
<ul>OpenVAS -> Scans -> Task -> Task Wizart -> 192.168.10.144</ul>
<ul>Wait for the scan to finish</ul>
<ul>Look at the report</ul>
<ul>Result: FTP Unencrypted Cleartext Login</ul>
</ol></p>

<h2>Flags</h2>
    
<p>Challenge 1:</p>
<p>You are assigned to perform brute-force attack on a linux machine from 192.168.10.0/24 subnet and crack the FTP credentials of user nick. 
    An exploitation information file is saved in the home directory of the FTP server. Determine the Vendor homepage of the FTP vulnerability specified in the file. 
    (Format: aaaaa://aaa.aaaaaaaa.aaa/)</p>
    <p>Answer: first we want to know the FTP credentials of nick and we use the amazing <a href=cookbook/password_spraying.html>hydra</a> to do this:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>cd ~/Desktop</ul>
        <ul>sudo hydra -l nick -P password.txt 192.168.10.111 ftp</ul>
        <ul>The password is <b>apple</b></ul>
        <ul>ftp 192.168.10.111</ul>
        <ul>after login we see a directory structure and a file named 52012.py</ul>
        <ul>In order to investigate this file, we download it to our computer</ul>
        <ul>get 52012.py</ul>
        <ul>Using an editor we see the answer: https://www.crushftp.com</ul>
    </ol></p>
<p>Challenge 2:</p>
<p>An intruder performed network sniffing on a machine from 192.168.10.0/24 subnet and obtained login credentials of the user for moviescope.com website 
    using remote packet capture in wireshark. You are assigned to analyse the Mscredremote.pcapng file located in Downloads folder of EH Workstation-1 and 
    determine the credentials obtained. (Format: aaaa/aaaaa)</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Go to Workstation - 1 and double click the Mscredremote.pcapng file</ul>
        <ul>In Wireshark -> in the "apply a display filter" field, type <b>http.request.method == POST</b> to filter only http POST traffic packets</ul>
        <ul>Navigate to Edit -> Find Packet from the menu bar</ul>
        <ul>Click Display filter, select String from the dropdown options, click Narrow & Wide and select Narrow (UTF-8 / ASCII)</ul>
        <ul>Click Packet list, select Packet details from the dropdown options</ul>

    </ol></p>

<p>Challenge 3:</p>
<p>You are assigned to analyse a packet capture file ServerDoS.pcapng located in Downloads folder of EH Workstation-2 machine. 
    Determine the UDP based application layer protocol which attacker employed to flood the machine in targeted network. Note: Check for target Destination port. 
    (Format: Aaaaa Aaaaaaa Aaaaaaaa)</p>
    <p>Answer: we get a very important tip -> check for target Destination port</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Open ServerDos.pcapng in wireshark</ul>
        <ul>Double click an interesting row (UDP protocol)</ul>
        <ul>In the UDP datagram we can see the Dest port is 26.000</ul>
        <ul>Some old school OSINT tells us that port 26.000 is used by Quake</ul>
        <ul>It's a kind of hard to find the official name for the protocol Quake uses</ul>
        <ul>Wireshark keeps a list of official protocol names at https://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/</ul>
        <ul>The answer for this challenge is <b>Quake Network Protocol</b></ul>
    </ol></p>
<p>Challenge 4:</p>
    <p>A severe DDoS attack is occurred in an organization, degrading the performance of a ubuntu server machine in the SKILL.CEH network. 
        You are assigned to analyse the DD_attack.pcapng file stored in Documents folder of EH workstation -2 and determine the IP address of the attacker 
        trying to attack the target server through UDP. (Format: NNN.NNN.NN.NNN)</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Open the pcap file in wireshark</ul>
        <ul>Order the rows on column Protocol so we get a list of UDP below each other</ul>
        <ul>answer to this challenge is 192.168.10.144</ul>
    </ol></p>
<p>Challenge 5:</p>
    <p>You are assigned to analyse PyD_attack.pcapng file stored in Downloads folder of EH Workstation -2 machine. Determine the attacker IP machine which 
        is targeting the RPC service of the target machine. (Format: NNN.NN.NN.NN)</p>
    <p>Answer: searching for rdp in wireshark gives no results. It's important to know that RDP makes use of port 135</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Load the pcap file in wireshark</ul>
        <ul>search for tcp.dstport == 135</ul>
        <ul>answer to this challenge is 172.30.10.99</ul>
    </ol></p>
<p>Challenge 6:</p>
    <p>An incident handler identified severe DDoS attack on a network and provided report using Anti-DDoS Guardian tool. You are assigned to analyse the 
        reports submitted by the IH team which are stored in "C:\Users\Admin\Documents\Anti-DDoS" directory of the EH Workstation-1 and determine the attacker 
        IP which has transmitted more number of packets to the target machine. (Format: NNN.NNN.NN.NNN)</p>
    <p>Answer: there is only one report text file. This file contains delimited values and can be opened in Excel. I opened this file in Excel and converted 
    it into a Table. We can see that IP <b>192.168.10.222</b> has sent a large amount of packets to the target machine.</p>
<p>Challenge 7:</p>
<p>You are assigned to analyse the domain controller from the target subnet and perform AS-REP roasting attack on the user accounts and determine the 
    password of the vulnerable user whose credentials are obtained. Note: use users.txt and rockyou.txt files stored in attacker home directory while 
    cracking the credentials. (Format: aNaaN*NNN)</p>
    <p>Answer: I created a <a href=cookbook/active_directory_attacks.html>recipe</a> for AS-REP roasting attack.</p>
    <p>An AS-REP roasting attack targets user accounts in AD that do not require Kerberos pre-authentication, exploiting the DONT_REQ_PREAUTH setting. 
        Attackers can request a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) for these accounts without needing the user's password. The DC responds with an encrypted TGT, 
        which the attacker captures. This TGT, encrypted with the user's password hash, is then subjected to offline password-cracking tools such as 
        Hashcat or John the Ripper. By rapidly guessing the password, the attacker can eventually decrypt the TGT, revealing the user's password.</p>

<p>Challenge 8:</p>
    <p>A client machine under the target domain controller has a misconfigured SQL server vulnerability. Your task is to exploit this vulnerability, 
        retrieve the MSS.txt file located in the Public Downloads folder on the client machine and determine its size in bytes as answer. 
        Note: use users.txt and rockyou.txt files stored in attacker home directory while cracking the credentials. (Format: N)</p>
    <p>At first, this was not so easy to find out, but by reading the information in the challenge it is clear that we have to use Metasploit to get a 
        meterpreter on the target and retrieve the flag. Also, we need Hydra and CrackMapExec for post-exploitation. 
        There's always <a target=_blank href=https://attackdefense.com/challengedetailsnoauth?cid=2321>on-line information</a>.</p>
