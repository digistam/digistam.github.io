<h1>Enumeration</h1>
<p>It's important to have some clue where to begin with enumerating. Otherwise, it can be hard and overwhelming.</p>
    <h2>Remote Procedure Calls</h2>
    <p>
    <p>Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a <b>service</b> that allows remote machines to consume procedures external to the application calling them.
    A common implementation of remote procedure calls is the program <b>portmap</b>, also known as <b>rpcbind</b>. Common examples of services that use 
    rpcbind/portmap are file sharing servers like <b>Network File Server (NFS)</b>. The package that provides the portmap or rpcbind service may also 
    provide utilities that can also communicate using RPC. This is done over port 111. To identify programs and associated ports on a remote system, you 
    can use the program <b>rpcinfo</b>.</p>
    <p><b>sudo rpcinfo -p 192.168.1.254</b></p>
    Following the CEH course, we can start with RCP, SMB, NetBios. In other words: ports 135 (RPC), 
    136 (profile), 137 (netbios name service), 138 (netbios datagram service), 139 (netbios session service), 445 (SMB)</p>
    <h2>Nmap port scan</h2>
    <p><b>sudo nmap -sS -p 135-139,445 192.168.1.1/24</b></p>
    <p>Example result: 192.168.1.216</p>
    <h2>Nmap enumeration scripts</h2>
    <p><b>sudo nmap --script-help "*netbios*"</b></p>
    <p>We can see it's possible to use the broadcast-netbios-master-browser script:</p>
    <p><b>sudo nmap --script "broadcast-netbios-master-browser" 192.168.1.216</b></p>
    <p>If port 445 (microsoft-ds, smb) is open, we can fire up all smb scripts:</p>
    <p><b>sudo nmap --script "*smb*" 192.168.2.216</b></p>
    <p>That can be an overkill in information, so we can for example focus on known smb vulnerabilities:</p>
    <p><b>sudo nmap --script "smb-vuln*" 192.168.1.216</b></p>
