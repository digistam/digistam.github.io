<h1>Upload files to Github</h1>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>It can be important to upload tools to Github, especially where it comes to hacking tools (there are a lot of infected files out in the open) and the tools can't be downloaded from Github itself. When you 
have a good, thorougly tested tool, make a backup of it in a personal Github repo. Unfortunately, you can't upload files directly using the webbrowser.</p>
  <p><ol>
    <ul>Download <a target=_blank href=https://git-scm.com/downloads>Github installer</a></ul>
    <ul>Copy the files to a directory on the computer</ul>
    <ul>cd to this directory</ul>
    <ul>git init</ul>
    <ul>git status</ul>
    <ul>git add <filename / foldername></ul>
