<h1>IPsec</h1>
<p>Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a set of protocols that the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) developed to support the secure exchange of packets at the IP layer.
It ensures interoperable cryptographically based security for IPv4 and IPv6, and it supports network-level peer authentication, data origing authentication, data integrity, 
data confidentiality (encryption) and replay protection. It is widely used to implement VPNs and for remote user access through dial-up connections to private networks.</p>
    <p>IPsec policies can be assigned through the Group Policy configuration of Active Directory domains etc.</p>
    <h2>Components</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>IPsec driver</ul>
        <ul>Internet Key Exchange (IKE)</ul>
        <ul>Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP)</ul>
        <ul>Oakley -> a protocol that uses the Diffie-Hellman algorithm to create a master key and a key that is specific to each session in IPsec data transfer</ul>
        <ul>IPsec Policy Agent -> a service included in Windows OS that enforces IPsec policies for all the network communications initiated from that system</ul>
    </ol></p>
