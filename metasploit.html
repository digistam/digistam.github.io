<h1>Metasploit</h1>
<p><a target=_blank href=https://www.metasploit.com>The Metasploit Framework</a> is a penetration testing toolkit, exploit development platform and research tool that includes hundreds of working remote exploits for 
various platforms. It performs full automated exploitation of web servers by abusing known vulnerabilities and leveraging weak passwords via Telnet, SSH, HTTP and SNMP.</p>
    <p>An attacker may use the following features of Metasploit to perform a web server attack:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Closed-loop vulnerability validation</ul>
        <ul>Phishing simulations</ul>
        <ul>Social engineering</ul>
        <ul>Manual brute forcing</ul>
        <ul>Manual exploitation</ul>
        <ul>Evade-leading defensive solutions</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>Metasploit enables pen testers to perform the following:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Quickly complete pen-test assignments by automating repetitive tasks and leveraging multi-level attacks</ul>
        <ul>Assess the security of web applications, network and endpoint systems, as well as email users</ul>
        <ul>Tunnel any traffic through compromised targets to pivot deep into a network</ul>
        <ul>Customize the content and template of executive, audit and technical reports</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <h2>Metasploit Architecture</h2>
    <p>The Metasploit Framework is an open-source exploitation framework that provides security researchers and pen testers with a uniform model for the rapid development of exploits, payloads, encoders, no 
    operation (NOP) generators and reconnaissance tools. The framework reuses large chunks of code that a user would otherwise have to copy or re-implememnt on a per-exploit basis. The framwork is modular in 
    architecture and encourages the reuse of code across various projects. The framework can be broken down into a few different pieces, the lowest level of which is the framework core. The framework core is 
    responsible for implementing all the required interfaces that allow interaction with exploit modules, sessions and plugins. It supports vulnerability research, exploit development and the creation of 
    custom security tools.</p>

    <h2>Metasploit Modules</h2>
    <h2>Metasploit Exploit Module</h2>
    <p>Basic module in Metasploit used to encapsulate a single exploit, using which users target many platforms. This module has simplified meta-information fields. Using the Mixins feature, users can also 
    dynamically modify exploit behavior, perform brute-force attack and attempts passive exploits.</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Configure an active exploit</ul>
        <ul>Verify the exploit options</ul>
        <ul>Select a target</ul>
        <ul>Select a payload</ul>
        <ul>Launch the exploit</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <h2>Metasploit Payload Module</h2>
    <p>An exploit carries a payload in its backpack when it breaks into a system and then leaves the backpack there. The following three types of payload modules are provided by the Metasploit Framework:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Singles -> self contained and completely standalone</ul>
        <ul>Stagers -> sets up a network connection between the attacker and victim</ul>
        <ul>Stages -> downloaded by stager modules</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>A Metasploit payload module can upload and download files from the system, take screenshots and collect password hashes. It can even take over the screen, mouse and keyboard to control a computer 
    remotely. The payload Module establishes a communication channel between the Metasploit framework and victim host. It combines arbitrary code that is executed as the result of an exploit succeeding. 
    To generate payloads, a payload is first selected using the command <i>use windows/shell_reverse_tcp</i></p>

    <h2>Metasploit Auxiliary Module</h2>
    <p>Auxiliary modules can be used to perform arbitrary, one-off actions such as port scanning, DoS and even fuzzing. It includes tools and modules that assess the security of the target as well as 
    auxiliary modules such as scanners, DoS modules and fuzzers. Use <i>show auxiliary</i> to list all the available auxiliary modules in Metasploit. All modules in Metasploit other than the ones used to 
    exploit are auxiliary modules. Metasploit uses auxiliary modules as an extension for various purposes other than exploitation. These modules are stored in in the modules/auxiliary/ directory of the 
    framework's main directory. The <i>run</i> command or the <i>exploit</i> command can be used to run an auxiliary module.</p>

    <h2>Metasploit NOPS module</h2>
    <p>NOPS generate no-operation instructions used for blocking out buffers.</p>

    <h1>Commands</h1>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>search -h</ul>
        <ul>search rpc type:aux</ul>
        <ul>search ssh type:aux</ul>
        <ul>use ssh_enum type:aux</ul>
    </ol></p>
