<h1>Launch of Wireless Attacks</h1>
<p>After completing the wireless network discovery, mapping, and analysis of the target wireless network, an attacker will be in a position to launch an attack on the target wireless network. The attacker 
    may launch various types of attacks such as fragmentation attacks, MAC spoofing attacks, DoS attacks and Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning attacks.</p>
    <h2>Aircrack-ng Suite</h2>
    <p><a target=_blank href=https://www.aircrack-ng.org>Aircrack-ng</a> is a network software suite consisting of a detector, packet sniffer, WEP / WPA / WPA2 PSK cracker and analysis tool for 802.11 
    wireless networks</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Airbase-ng: captures WPA/WPA2 handshake and can act as an ad-hoc AP</ul>
        <ul>Aircrack-ng: de facto WEP / WPA / WPA2 cracking tool</ul>
        <ul>Airdecap-ng: decrypts WEP / WPA / WPA2 and can be used to strip wireless headers from Wi-Fi packets</ul>
        <ul>Airdecloak-ng: removes WEP cloaking from a pcap file</ul>
        <ul>Airdrop-ng: program used for targeted, rule-based de-authentication of users</ul>
        <ul>Aireplay-ng: used for traffic generation, fake authentication, packet replay and ARP request injection</ul>
        <ul>Airgraph-ng: creates a client-AP relationship and common probe graph from an airodump file</ul>
        <ul>Airmon-ng: used to switch from managed mode to monitor mode on wireless interfaces</ul>
        <ul>Airodump-ng: capture packets of raw 802.11 frames and collect WEP IVs</ul>
        <ul>Airolib-ng: stores and manages ESSID and password lists used in WPA/WPA2 cracking</ul>
        <ul>Airserv-ng: allows multiple programs to independently use a Wi-Fi card via a client-server TCP connection</ul>
        <ul>Airtun-ng: creates a virtual tunnel interface to monitor encrypted traffic and inject arbitrary traffic into a network</ul>
        <ul>Easside-ng: allows to communicate via a WEP-encrypted AP without knowing the WEP key</ul>
        <ul>Packetforge-ng: use this program to create encrypted packets that can subsequently be used for injection</ul>
        <ul>Tkiptun-ng: injects frames into a WPA TKIP network with QoS and can recover MIC keys and keystreams from Wi-Fi traffic</ul>
        <ul>Wesside-ng: seamlessly obtain a WEP key in minutes</ul>
        <ul>WZCook: recover WEP keys from the Wireless Zero Configuration utility of Win XP</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>Detection of Hidden SSIDs</h2>
    <p>Based on the principle of security through obscurity, many organizations hide the SSID of their wireless network by not broadcasting it. However, hiding SSID does NOT increase security. An attacker 
    can reveal a hidden SSID using the <b>aircrack-ng</b> suite through the following steps:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Run <b>Airmon-ng</b> in the <b>monitor</b> mode</ul>
        <ul>Start <b>airodump-ng</b> to discover SSIDs on the interface</ul>
        <ul><b>De-authenticat (deauth -> -0)</b> the client to reveal hidden SSID using <b>Aireplay-ng</b></ul>
        <ul>Switch to <b>airodump</b> to view the revealed SSID</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>Fragmentation Attack</h2>
