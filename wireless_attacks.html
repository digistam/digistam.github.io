<h1>Launch of Wireless Attacks</h1>
<p>After completing the wireless network discovery, mapping, and analysis of the target wireless network, an attacker will be in a position to launch an attack on the target wireless network. The attacker 
    may launch various types of attacks such as fragmentation attacks, MAC spoofing attacks, DoS attacks and Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning attacks.</p>
    <h2>Aircrack-ng Suite</h2>
    <p><a target=_blank href=https://www.aircrack-ng.org>Aircrack-ng</a> is a network software suite consisting of a detector, packet sniffer, WEP / WPA / WPA2 PSK cracker and analysis tool for 802.11 
    wireless networks</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Airbase-ng: captures WPA/WPA2 handshake and can act as an ad-hoc AP</ul>
        <ul>Aircrack-ng: de facto WEP / WPA / WPA2 cracking tool</ul>
        <ul>Airdecap-ng: decrypts WEP / WPA / WPA2 and can be used to strip wireless headers from Wi-Fi packets</ul>
        <ul>Airdecloak-ng: removes WEP cloaking from a pcap file</ul>
        <ul>Airdrop-ng: program used for targeted, rule-based de-authentication of users</ul>
        <ul>Aireplay-ng: used for traffic generation, fake authentication, packet replay and ARP request injection</ul>
        <ul>Airgraph-ng: creates a client-AP relationship and common probe graph from an airodump file</ul>
        <ul>Airmon-ng: used to switch from managed mode to monitor mode on wireless interfaces</ul>
        <ul>Airodump-ng: capture packets of raw 802.11 frames and collect WEP IVs</ul>
        <ul>Airolib-ng: stores and manages ESSID and password lists used in WPA/WPA2 cracking</ul>
        <ul>Airserv-ng: allows multiple programs to independently use a Wi-Fi card via a client-server TCP connection</ul>
        <ul>Airtun-ng: creates a virtual tunnel interface to monitor encrypted traffic and inject arbitrary traffic into a network</ul>
        <ul>Easside-ng: allows to communicate via a WEP-encrypted AP without knowing the WEP key</ul>
        <ul>Packetforge-ng: use this program to create encrypted packets that can subsequently be used for injection</ul>
        <ul>Tkiptun-ng: injects frames into a WPA TKIP network with QoS and can recover MIC keys and keystreams from Wi-Fi traffic</ul>
        <ul>Wesside-ng: seamlessly obtain a WEP key in minutes</ul>
        <ul>WZCook: recover WEP keys from the Wireless Zero Configuration utility of Win XP</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>Detection of Hidden SSIDs</h2>
    <p>Based on the principle of security through obscurity, many organizations hide the SSID of their wireless network by not broadcasting it. However, hiding SSID does NOT increase security. An attacker 
    can reveal a hidden SSID using the <b>aircrack-ng</b> suite through the following steps:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Run <b>Airmon-ng</b> in the <b>monitor</b> mode</ul>
        <ul><b>sudo airmon-ng start wlan0</b></ul>
        <ul>Start <b>airodump-ng</b> to discover SSIDs on the interface</ul>
        <ul><b>De-authenticat (deauth -> -0)</b> the client to reveal hidden SSID using <b>Aireplay-ng</b></ul>
        <ul><b>sudo aireplay-ng -0 1 -a [BSSID] wlan0</b></ul>
        <ul>Switch to <b>airodump</b> to view the revealed SSID</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>Fragmentation Attack</h2>
<p>A succesful fragmentation attack can obtain 1500 bytes of a pseudo-random generation algorith (PRGA). However, this attack does not directly recover the WEP key. At least one data packet must be 
received from the target AP to initiate this attack. The <b>aircrack-ng</b> suite helps the attacker obtain a small amount of keying material from the packet, following which it attempts to send ARP and/or 
logical link control (LLC) packets with known content to the AP. The attacker can gather a larger amount of keying information from the replay packet if the AP echoes this packet. An attacker repeats this 
cycle several times to obtain the PRTG. The attacker can use PRGA with <b>packetforge-ng</b> to generate packets for injection attacks.</p>

    <h2>MAC Spoofing Attack</h2>
    <p>A MAC address is a unique identifier hard coded in the circuit of a network card by its manufacturer. Some networks implement MAC address filtering as a security measure. In MAC spoofing, attackers 
    change their MAC address to that of an authenticated user to bypass the MAC filtering configured in an AP. To spoof a MAC address, the attacker simply needs to set the value returned by ifconfig to 
    another hex value in the format of aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff. This change is made with sudo. Attackers use MAC spoofing tools such as <a target=_blank href=https://technitium.com/tmac/>Technitium MAC Address Changer</a>,  
        <a target=_blank href=https://smac-tool.com/>SMAC Address Spoofing Tool</a> and <a target=_blank href=https://lizardsystems.com/change-mac-address/>Change Mac Address</a></p>

    <h2>DoS: Disassociation and De-authentication Attacks</h2>
    <p>In a <b>disassocation attack</b>, the attacker makes the victim unavailable to other wireless devices by destroying the connectivity between the AP and client. </p>
    <p>In a <b>de-authentication attack</b>, the attacker floods station(s) with forged de-authenticates or disassociates to disconnect users from an AP.</p>

    <h2>MITM Attack</h2>
    <p>A MITM attack is an active internet attack in which the attacker attempts to intercept, read or alter information transmitted between two computers</p>
    <h2>Eavesdropping</h2>
    <p>Eavesdropping is easy in a wireless network because no physical medium is used for communication. An attacker in the vicinity of a wireless network can receive radio waves on the wireless 
    network without much effort or equipment. Furthermore, the attacker can examine the entire data frame sent across the network or store it for later assessment.</p>
    <p>Several layers of encryption are needed to prevent attackers from obtaining sensitive information. WEP or data-link encryption can be used in these layers. Further, a security mechanism such as IPsec, 
    SSH or SSL must be used, failing which sent data may be available to attackers. </p>
    <p>However, an attacker can crack WEP with tools freely available. A skilled hacker can potentially log gigabytes of WEP-protected traffic, post-process that data, and break the encryption.</p>
    <h2>Manipulation</h2>
    <p>Manipulation is a level beyond eavesdropping. It occurs when an attacker receives the victim's encrypted data, manipulates it, and retransmits the manipulated data to the victim. In addition, an 
    attacker can intercept packets with encrypted data and change the destination address to forward these packets across the internet.</p>
    <p>An attacker performs a MITM attack through the following steps:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>The attacker sniffs the victim's wireless parameters (MAC address, ESSID/BSSID and number of channels)</ul>
        <ul>The attacker sends a DEAUTH request to the victim with a spoofed source address or the victim's AP</ul>
        <ul>On receiving the request, the victim's computer is de-authenticated and starts to search all channels for a new valid AP</ul>
        <ul>The attacker sets a forged AP on a new channel with the original MAC address (BSSID) and ESSID of the victim's AP, thereby connecting the victim to the forged AP</ul>
        <ul>After the victim's successful association to the forged AP, the attacker spoofs the victim to connect to the original AP</ul>
        <ul>The attacker positions themselves between the AP and victim, listening to all traffic</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>MITM Attack using Aircrack-ng</h2>
    <p>An attacker can perform an MITM attack using <b>aircrak-ng</b> through the following steps:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Run airmon-ng in the monitor mode</ul>
        <ul>Start airodump to discover SSIDs on the interface</ul>
        <ul>De-authenticate (deauth) the client using aireplay-ng</ul>
        <ul>Associate the wireless card (fake association) with the AP to be accessed with aireplay-ng</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>Wireless ARP Poisoning Attack</h2>
    <p>ARP determines the MAC address of an AP if it already knows its IP address. Usually, ARP does not possess any feature to verify whether the responses are from valid hosts. ARP poisoning is an attack 
    technique that exploits this lack of verification. In this technique, the ARP cache maintained by the OS is corrupted with wrong MAC addresses. An attacker achieves this by sending an ARP replay packet 
    constructed with a wrong MAC address. </p>
    <p>An ARP poisoning attack impacts all the hosts in a subnet. All stations associated with a subnet affected by an ARP poisoning attack are vulnerable because most APs act as transparent MAC-layer bridges.
    All hosts connected to a switch or hub are susceptible to ARP poisoning attacks if the AP is connected directly to that switch or hub without any router / firewall between them. </p>

    <h2>ARP Poisoning Attack using Ettercap</h2>
    <p>Attackers use Ettercap to identify the MAC addresses of the clients and routers for performing various attacks such as ARP poisoning, sniffing and MITM attacks. Using this tool, an attacker can obtain 
    all the information about the network traffic of the victim. An attacker performs an ARP poisoning attack using Ettercap through the following steps:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Launch the Ettercap graphical interface and enable the unified sniffing option by selecting <b>Sniff</b> -> <b>Unified Sniffing</b> from the menu bar. This allows the attacker to bridge the 
        connection and sniff the traffic crossing the interfaces.</ul>
        <ul>In the Ettercap <b>Setup</b> pop-up window, set the <b>Primary interface</b> to sniff and click on <b>OK</b>. This will show advanced menu options such as targets, hosts, MITM and plugins.</ul>
        <ul>Identify the target host in the network by selecting <b>Hosts</b> -> <b>Scan for Hosts</b>. Ettercap performs a scan of all live hosts in the network and displays a list of hosts. Next, select 
        <b>Hosts</b> -> <b>Hosts List</b> to view all the hosts discovered on the local network</ul>
        <ul>Select <b>View</b> -> <b>Connections</b> to start snooping on the identified connections. The connections can be filtered in the <b>Connections</b> view based on the IP address, type of 
        connection and state of connection (open / closed / active / killed).</ul>
        <ul>Select the hosts to perform an ARP spoofing attack. Go to the <b>Hosts</b> window and select the target IP address. Select <b>Targets</b> -> <b>Current targets</b> to add a list of target hosts 
        to use for ARP spoofing</ul>
        <ul>Select <b>MITM</b> -> <b>ARP poisoning</b>. In the pop-up window that appears, select <b>Sniff remote connections</b> and click <b>OK</b> to launch an ARP poisoning attack on the target</ul>
        <ul>Once the attack is launched, the target host's login credentials can also be sniffed if the web traffic is not encrypted with HTTPS</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>Rogue APs</h2>
    <p>Rogue APs are wireless APs that an attacker installs on a network without authorization and are not under the management of the network administrator. The rogue AP can provide backdoor access to the 
    target wireless network.</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Compact, pocket-sized rogue AP plugged into Ethernet port</ul>
        <ul>Rogue AP connected to corporate networks over a Wi-Fi link -> requires credentials of target network</ul>
        <ul>USB-based rogue AP plugged into a network machine -> eliminates need for unused Ethernet port and credentials of target AP</ul>
        <ul>Software based rogue AP running on a network Windows machine</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Choose appropriate location to plug in rogue AP for maximum coverage</ul>
        <ul>Disable SSID broadcast (silent mode) and any management features to avoid detection</ul>
        <ul>Place the AP behind a firewall, if possible, to avoid network scanners</ul>
        <ul>Deploy the rogue AP for a short while</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>Evil Twin</h2>
    <p>An Evil Twin is a wireless AP that pretends to be a legitimate AP by imitating its SSID. An attacker sets up a rogue AP outside the network perimeter and lures users to sign in to this AP.
    Because employees of a company may take their corporate laptops to establishments with public Wi-Fi networks, it is challenging to keep company data safe. A fake hotspot can be set up using a 
    laptop with internet connectivity and a mini AP:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Enable Internet Connection Sharing in Windows or Internet Sharing in MacOS</ul>
        <ul>Broadcast the Wi-Fi connection and run a sniffer program to capture passwords</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>aLTEr Attack</h2>
    <p>An aLTEr attack has the following two phases:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Information gathering phase -> identity mapping and website fingerprinting</ul>
        <ul>Attack phase -> active attack using techniques as DNS spoofing</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>Information gathering -> attackers snoop on the websites that users attempt to access and record how often they visit those websites. Attackers only spy or monitor the transmission between the base 
    station and the end user, and they do not modify any credentials or information in this attack</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Identity mapping -> the attacker maps the identity to locate the target device, once determined, the attacker devises a strategy to implement the next two attacks</ul>
        <ul>Website fingerprinting -> the attacker records the amount of traffic the client is accessing and keeps track of the user's online activities and other meta information</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>Attack phase -> after snooping or gathering information about the target users, the attacker launches an MITM attack using a fake tower impeding and manipulating the user data, which are intended 
    to be shared with the real tower. The attacker uses DNS spoofing to redirect the victim to a malicious website or a website of their choice, where the attacker records all the sensitive information entered
    by the victim such as usernames and passwords.</p>

    <h2>Wi-Jacking Attack</h2>
    <p>Attackers use a Wi-Jacking attack for gaining access to an enormous number of wireless networks. In this attack, the Wi-Fi information of the nearest victims can be retrieved without using any 
    cracking mechanisms. This attack can be used when credentials are saved in the victim's browser, when the victim accesses the same website multiple times, and when the router uses an unencrypted HTTP
    connection to access the router configuration interface in the browser. Attackers can take advantage of these vulnerabilities to crack WPA/WPA2 networks without going through a single handshake process.
    The following conditions must be met to perform a Wi-Jacking attack:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>At least one active client device must be connected to the target network</ul>
        <ul>The client device must have already connected to any open network and allow automatic reconnection to that network</ul>
        <ul>The client device must use a chromium - based web browser</ul>
        <ul>The client device's browser must store the admin interface credentials of the router</ul>
        <ul>The target network's router must use an unencrypted HTTP connection for the router configuration interface</ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>Attackers launch a Wi-Jacking attack through the following steps:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Send de-authentication requests to the victim's device using aireplay-ng to disconnect the victim from their legitimate Wi-Fi network</ul>
        <ul>Perform a KARMA attack using "hostapd-wpe", luring the victim to connect to the malicious Wi-Fi network</ul>
        <ul>After succesful de-authentication, use tools such as <b>dnsmasq</b> and Python scripts to inject a malicious URL and force the victim's browser to load that malicious URL. 
        Based on the BSSID and ESSID, the URL/page pair to be sent can be detected</ul>
        <ul>Wait for the victim to access the HTTP page. At this moment, the victim's router is updated and automatically restarted</ul>
        <ul>Once the victim opens the malicious page, the browser will check the following two conditions to automatically load the page having stored credentials:</ul>
        <ul>- do the malicous URL and the router's admin interface have the same origin ?</ul>
        <ul>- do the input fields of the page and the router's admin interface match ?</ul>
        <ul>After receiving the credentials, the victim is made to access the page for some more time. Subsequently, stop the KARMA attack and allow the victim to connect back to 
        their legitimate network. Once the victim's device is connected to the legitimate network, the malicious page remains in the router's admin interface, along with admin credentials 
        loaded into the JavaScript</ul>
        <ul>Use XMLHttpRequest to login to the router to extract the victim's WPA2 PSK and further perform any other malicious changes as necessary. Using this PSK and other credentials, 
        the victim's private network can be hacked, and critical data can be accessed and tampered using the Wi-Jacking technique.</ul>
    </ol></p>
