<h1>Launch of Wireless Attacks</h1>
<p>After completing the wireless network discovery, mapping, and analysis of the target wireless network, an attacker will be in a position to launch an attack on the target wireless network. The attacker 
    may launch various types of attacks such as fragmentation attacks, MAC spoofing attacks, DoS attacks and Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning attacks.</p>
    <h2>Aircrack-ng Suite</h2>
    <p><a target=_blank href=https://www.aircrack-ng.org>Aircrack-ng</a> is a network software suite consisting of a detector, packet sniffer, WEP / WPA / WPA2 PSK cracker and analysis tool for 802.11 
    wireless networks</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Airbase-ng: captures WPA/WPA2 handshake and can act as an ad-hoc AP</ul>
        <ul>Aircrack-ng: de facto WEP / WPA / WPA2 cracking tool</ul>
        <ul>Airdecap-ng: decrypts WEP / WPA / WPA2 and can be used to strip wireless headers from Wi-Fi packets</ul>
        <ul>Airdecloak-ng: removes WEP cloaking from a pcap file</ul>
        <ul>Airdrop-ng: program used for targeted, rule-based de-authentication of users</ul>
        <ul>Aireplay-ng: used for traffic generation, fake authentication, packet replay and ARP request injection</ul>
        <ul>Airgraph-ng: creates a client-AP relationship and common probe graph from an airodump file</ul>
        <ul>Airmon-ng: used to switch from managed mode to monitor mode on wireless interfaces</ul>
        <ul>Airodump-ng: capture packets of raw 802.11 frames and collect WEP IVs</ul>
        <ul>Airolib-ng: stores and manages ESSID and password lists used in WPA/WPA2 cracking</ul>
        <ul>Airserv-ng: allows multiple programs to independently use a Wi-Fi card via a client-server TCP connection</ul>
        <ul>Airtun-ng: creates a virtual tunnel interface to monitor encrypted traffic and inject arbitrary traffic into a network</ul>
        <ul>Easside-ng: allows to communicate via a WEP-encrypted AP without knowing the WEP key</ul>
        <ul>Packetforge-ng: use this program to create encrypted packets that can subsequently be used for injection</ul>
        <ul>Tkiptun-ng: injects frames into a WPA TKIP network with QoS and can recover MIC keys and keystreams from Wi-Fi traffic</ul>
        <ul>Wesside-ng: seamlessly obtain a WEP key in minutes</ul>
        <ul>WZCook: recover WEP keys from the Wireless Zero Configuration utility of Win XP</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>Detection of Hidden SSIDs</h2>
    <p>Based on the principle of security through obscurity, many organizations hide the SSID of their wireless network by not broadcasting it. However, hiding SSID does NOT increase security. An attacker 
    can reveal a hidden SSID using the <b>aircrack-ng</b> suite through the following steps:</p>
    <p><ol>
        <ul>Run <b>Airmon-ng</b> in the <b>monitor</b> mode</ul>
        <ul>Start <b>airodump-ng</b> to discover SSIDs on the interface</ul>
        <ul><b>De-authenticat (deauth -> -0)</b> the client to reveal hidden SSID using <b>Aireplay-ng</b></ul>
        <ul>Switch to <b>airodump</b> to view the revealed SSID</ul>
    </ol></p>

    <h2>Fragmentation Attack</h2>
<p>A succesful fragmentation attack can obtain 1500 bytes of a pseudo-random generation algorith (PRGA). However, this attack does not directly recover the WEP key. At least one data packet must be 
received from the target AP to initiate this attack. The <b>aircrack-ng</b> suite helps the attacker obtain a small amount of keying material from the packet, following which it attempts to send ARP and/or 
logical link control (LLC) packets with known content to the AP. The attacker can gather a larger amount of keying information from the replay packet if the AP echoes this packet. An attacker repeats this 
cycle several times to obtain the PRTG. The attacker can use PRGA with <b>packetforge-ng</b> to generate packets for injection attacks.</p>

    <h2>MAC Spoofing Attack</h2>
    <p>A MAC address is a unique identifier hard coded in the circuit of a network card by its manufacturer. Some networks implement MAC address filtering as a security measure. In MAC spoofing, attackers 
    change their MAC address to that of an authenticated user to bypass the MAC filtering configured in an AP. To spoof a MAC address, the attacker simply needs to set the value returned by ifconfig to 
    another hex value in the format of aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff. This change is made with sudo. Attackers use MAC spoofing tools such as <a target=_blank href=https://technitium.com/tmac/>Technitium MAC Address Changer</a>,  
        <a target=_blank href=https://smac-tool.com/>SMAC Address Spoofing Tool</a> and <a target=_blank href=https://lizardsystems.com/change-mac-address/>Change Mac Address</a></p>

    <h2>DoS: Disassociation and De-authentication Attacks</h2>
    <p>In a <b>disassocation attack</b>, the attacker makes the victim unavailable to other wireless devices by destroying the connectivity between the AP and client. </p>
    <p>In a <b>de-authentication attack</b>, the attacker floods station(s) with forged de-authenticates or disassociates to disconnect users from an AP.</p>

    <h2>MITM Attack</h2>
    <p>A MITM attack is an active internet attack in which the attacker attempts to intercept, read or alter information transmitted between two computers</p>
    <h2>Eavesdropping</h2>
    <p>Eavesdropping is easy in a wireless network because no physical medium is used for communication. An attacker in the vicinity of a wireless network can receive radio waves on the wireless 
    network without much effort or equipment. Furthermore, the attacker can examine the entire data frame sent across the network or store it for later assessment.</p>
