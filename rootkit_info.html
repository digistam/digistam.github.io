<h1>Hiding Files</h1>

<p>After an attacker has performed operations on the target system to gain escalated privileges, the malicious programs have to be hidden. A rootkit can be used. Protective applications such as antivirus, antimalware and antispyware will not be able to detect it. A rootkit allows the 
attacker to maintain direct access to the system, even in the future, without the victim knowing about it. <br/>

A rootkit is a software program designed to gain access to a computer without being detected. The goal is to gain root privileges to a system. It works by exploiting the vulnerabilities in the OS and it's applications. It builds a backdoor login process in the OS via which the attacker
can evade the standard login process. <br/>

With root access a rootkit may attempt to hide the traces of unauthorized access by modifying drivers or kernel modules and discarding active processes. A typical rootkit comprises backdoor programs, DDoS programs, packet sniffers, log-wiping utilities, IRC bots etc.<br/>

The attacker places a rootkit by:
  <ol>
<ul>Scanning for vulnerable computers and servers on the web</ul>
<ul>Wrapping the rootkit in a special package like a game</ul>
<ul>Installing it on public or corporate computers through social engineering</ul>
<ul>Launching a zero-day attack</ul>
  </ol>

Objectives of a rootkit:
<ol>
<ul>To root the host system and gain backdoor access</ul>
<ul>To mask attacker tracks and presence of malicious applications or processes</ul>
<ul>To gather personal information, sensitive data, network traffic etc. from the system</ul>
<ul>To store other malicious programs and act as a server resource for bot updates</ul>
</ol>
